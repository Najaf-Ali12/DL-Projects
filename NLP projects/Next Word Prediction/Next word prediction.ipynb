There is much more difference as\\n', 'to their best work than in the case of those others who are loved “by\\n', 'allowance” by convention, and because it is felt to be the right and\\n', 'proper thing to love them. And in the sect--fairly large and yet\\n', 'unusually choice--of Austenians or Janites, there would probably be\\n', 'found partisans of the claim to primacy of almost every one of the\\n', 'novels. To some the delightful freshness and humour of_ Northanger\\n', 'Abbey, _its completeness, finish, and_ entrain, _obscure the undoubted\\n', 'critical facts that its scale is small, and its scheme, after all, that\\n', 'of burlesque or parody, a kind in which the first rank is reached with\\n', 'difficulty._ Persuasion, _relatively faint in tone, and not enthralling\\n', 'in interest, has devotees who exalt above all the others its exquisite\\n', 'delicacy and keeping. The catastrophe of_ Mansfield Park _is admittedly\\n', 'theatrical, the hero and heroine are insipid, and the author has almost\\n', 'wickedly destroyed all romantic interest by expressly admitting that\\n', 'Edmund only took Fanny because Mary shocked him, and that Fanny might\\n', 'very likely have taken Crawford if he had been a little more assiduous;\\n', 'yet the matchless rehearsal-scenes and the characters of Mrs. Norris and\\n', 'others have secured, I believe, a considerable party for it._ Sense and\\n', 'Sensibility _has perhaps the fewest out-and-out admirers; but it does\\n', 'not want them._\\n', '\\n', '_I suppose, however, that the majority of at least competent votes\\n', 'would, all things considered, be divided between_ Emma _and the present\\n', 'book; and perhaps the vulgar verdict (if indeed a fondness for Miss\\n', 'Austen be not of itself a patent of exemption from any possible charge\\n', 'of vulgarity) would go for_ Emma. _It is the larger, the more varied, the\\n', 'more popular; the author had by the time of its composition seen rather\\n', 'more of the world, and had improved her general, though not her most\\n', 'peculiar and characteristic dialogue; such figures as Miss Bates, as the\\n', 'Eltons, cannot but unite the suffrages of everybody. On the other hand,\\n', 'I, for my part, declare for_ Pride and Prejudice _unhesitatingly. It\\n', 'seems to me the most perfect, the most characteristic, the most\\n', 'eminently quintessential of its author’s works; and for this contention\\n', 'in such narrow space as is permitted to me, I propose here to show\\n', 'cause._\\n', '\\n', '_In the first place, the book (it may be barely necessary to remind the\\n', 'reader) was in its first shape written very early, somewhere about 1796,\\n', 'when Miss Austen was barely twenty-one; though it was revised and\\n', 'finished at Chawton some fifteen years later, and was not published till\\n', '1813, only four years before her death. I do not know whether, in this\\n', 'combination of the fresh and vigorous projection of youth, and the\\n', 'critical revision of middle life, there may be traced the distinct\\n', 'superiority in point of construction, which, as it seems to me, it\\n', 'possesses over all the others. The plot, though not elaborate, is almost\\n', 'regular enough for Fielding; hardly a character, hardly an incident\\n', 'could be retrenched without loss to the story. The elopement of Lydia\\n', 'and Wickham is not, like that of Crawford and Mrs. Rushworth, a_ coup de\\n', 'théâtre; _it connects itself in the strictest way with the course of the\\n', 'story earlier, and brings about the denouement with complete propriety.\\n', 'All the minor passages--the loves of Jane and Bingley, the advent of Mr.\\n', 'Collins, the visit to Hunsford, the Derbyshire tour--fit in after the\\n', 'same unostentatious, but masterly fashion. There is no attempt at the\\n', 'hide-and-seek, in-and-out business, which in the transactions between\\n', 'Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax contributes no doubt a good deal to the\\n', 'intrigue of_ Emma, _but contributes it in a fashion which I do not think\\n', 'the best feature of that otherwise admirable book. Although Miss Austen\\n', 'always liked something of the misunderstanding kind, which afforded her\\n', 'opportunities for the display of the peculiar and incomparable talent to\\n', 'be noticed presently, she has been satisfied here with the perfectly\\n', 'natural occasions provided by the false account of Darcy’s conduct given\\n', 'by Wickham, and by the awkwardness (arising with equal naturalness) from\\n', 'the gradual transformation of Elizabeth’s own feelings from positive\\n', 'aversion to actual love. I do not know whether the all-grasping hand of\\n', 'the playwright has ever been laid upon_ Pride and Prejudice; _and I dare\\n', 'say that, if it were, the situations would prove not startling or\\n', 'garish enough for the footlights, the character-scheme too subtle and\\n', 'delicate for pit and gallery. But if the attempt were made, it would\\n', 'certainly not be hampered by any of those loosenesses of construction,\\n', 'which, sometimes disguised by the conveniences of which the novelist can\\n', 'avail himself, appear at once on the stage._\\n', '\\n', '_I think, however, though the thought will doubtless seem heretical to\\n', 'more than one school of critics, that construction is not the highest\\n', 'merit, the choicest gift, of the novelist. It sets off his other gifts\\n', 'and graces most advantageously to the critical eye; and the want of it\\n', 'will sometimes mar those graces--appreciably, though not quite\\n', 'consciously--to eyes by no means ultra-critical. But a very badly-built\\n', 'novel which excelled in pathetic or humorous character, or which\\n', 'displayed consummate command of dialogue--perhaps the rarest of all\\n', 'faculties--would be an infinitely better thing than a faultless plot\\n', 'acted and told by puppets with pebbles in their mouths. And despite the\\n', 'ability which Miss Austen has shown in working out the story, I for one\\n', 'should put_ Pride and Prejudice _far lower if it did not contain what\\n', 'seem to me the very masterpieces of Miss Austen’s humour and of her\\n', 'faculty of character-creation--masterpieces who may indeed admit John\\n', 'Thorpe, the Eltons, Mrs. Norris, and one or two others to their company,\\n', 'but who, in one instance certainly, and perhaps in others, are still\\n', 'superior to them._\\n', '\\n', '_The characteristics of Miss Austen’s humour are so subtle and delicate\\n', 'that they are, perhaps, at all times easier to apprehend than to\\n', 'express, and at any particular time likely to be differently\\n', 'apprehended by different persons. To me this humour seems to possess a\\n', 'greater affinity, on the whole, to that of Addison than to any other of\\n', 'the numerous species of this great British genus. The differences of\\n', 'scheme, of time, of subject, of literary convention, are, of course,\\n', 'obvious enough; the difference of sex does not, perhaps, count for much,\\n', 'for there was a distinctly feminine element in “Mr. Spectator,” and in\\n', 'Jane Austen’s genius there was, though nothing mannish, much that was\\n', 'masculine. But the likeness of quality consists in a great number of\\n', 'common subdivisions of quality--demureness, extreme minuteness of touch,\\n', 'avoidance of loud tones and glaring effects. Also there is in both a\\n', 'certain not inhuman or unamiable cruelty. It is the custom with those\\n', 'who judge grossly to contrast the good nature of Addison with the\\n', 'savagery of Swift, the mildness of Miss Austen with the boisterousness\\n', 'of Fielding and Smollett, even with the ferocious practical jokes that\\n', 'her immediate predecessor, Miss Burney, allowed without very much\\n', 'protest. Yet, both in Mr. Addison and in Miss Austen there is, though a\\n', 'restrained and well-mannered, an insatiable and ruthless delight in\\n', 'roasting and cutting up a fool. A man in the early eighteenth century,\\n', 'of course, could push this taste further than a lady in the early\\n', 'nineteenth; and no doubt Miss Austen’s principles, as well as her heart,\\n', 'would have shrunk from such things as the letter from the unfortunate\\n', 'husband in the_ Spectator, _who describes, with all the gusto and all the\\n', 'innocence in the world, how his wife and his friend induce him to play\\n', 'at blind-man’s-buff. But another_ Spectator _letter--that of the damsel\\n', 'of fourteen who wishes to marry Mr. Shapely, and assures her selected\\n', 'Mentor that “he admires your_ Spectators _mightily”--might have been\\n', 'written by a rather more ladylike and intelligent Lydia Bennet in the\\n', 'days of Lydia’s great-grandmother; while, on the other hand, some (I\\n', 'think unreasonably) have found “cynicism” in touches of Miss Austen’s\\n', 'own, such as her satire of Mrs. Musgrove’s self-deceiving regrets over\\n', 'her son. But this word “cynical” is one of the most misused in the\\n', 'English language, especially when, by a glaring and gratuitous\\n', 'falsification of its original sense, it is applied, not to rough and\\n', 'snarling invective, but to gentle and oblique satire. If cynicism means\\n', 'the perception of “the other side,” the sense of “the accepted hells\\n', 'beneath,” the consciousness that motives are nearly always mixed, and\\n', 'that to seem is not identical with to be--if this be cynicism, then\\n', 'every man and woman who is not a fool, who does not care to live in a\\n', 'fool’s paradise, who has knowledge of nature and the world and life, is\\n', 'a cynic. And in that sense Miss Austen certainly was one. She may even\\n', 'have been one in the further sense that, like her own Mr. Bennet, she\\n', 'took an epicurean delight in dissecting, in displaying, in setting at\\n', 'work her fools and her mean persons. I think she did take this delight,\\n', 'and I do not think at all the worse of her for it as a woman, while she\\n', 'was immensely the better for it as an artist._\\n', '\\n', '_In respect of her art generally, Mr. Goldwin Smith has truly observed\\n', 'that “metaphor has been exhausted in depicting the perfection of it,\\n', 'combined with the narrowness of her field;” and he has justly added that\\n', 'we need not go beyond her own comparison to the art of a miniature\\n', 'painter. To make this latter observation quite exact we must not use the\\n', 'term miniature in its restricted sense, and must think rather of Memling\\n', 'at one end of the history of painting and Meissonier at the other, than\\n', 'of Cosway or any of his kind. And I am not so certain that I should\\n', 'myself use the word “narrow” in connection with her. If her world is a\\n', 'microcosm, the cosmic quality of it is at least as eminent as the\\n', 'littleness. She does not touch what she did not feel herself called to\\n', 'paint; I am not so sure that she could not have painted what she did not\\n', 'feel herself called to touch. It is at least remarkable that in two very\\n', 'short periods of writing--one of about three years, and another of not\\n', 'much more than five--she executed six capital works, and has not left a\\n', 'single failure. It is possible that the romantic paste in her\\n', 'composition was defective: we must always remember that hardly\\n', 'anybody born in her decade--that of the eighteenth-century\\n', 'seventies--independently exhibited the full romantic quality. Even Scott\\n', 'required hill and mountain and ballad, even Coleridge metaphysics and\\n', 'German to enable them to chip the classical shell. Miss Austen was an\\n', 'English girl, brought up in a country retirement, at the time when\\n', 'ladies went back into the house if there was a white frost which might\\n', 'pierce their kid shoes, when a sudden cold was the subject of the\\n', 'gravest fears, when their studies, their ways, their conduct were\\n', 'subject to all those fantastic limits and restrictions against which\\n', 'Mary Wollstonecraft protested with better general sense than particular\\n', 'taste or judgment. Miss Austen, too, drew back when the white frost\\n', 'touched her shoes; but I think she would have made a pretty good journey\\n', 'even in a black one._\\n', '\\n', '_For if her knowledge was not very extended, she knew two things which\\n', 'only genius knows. The one was humanity, and the other was art. On the\\n', 'first head she could not make a mistake; her men, though limited, are\\n', 'true, and her women are, in the old sense, “absolute.” As to art, if she\\n', 'has never tried idealism, her realism is real to a degree which makes\\n', 'the false realism of our own day look merely dead-alive. Take almost any\\n', 'Frenchman, except the late M. de Maupassant, and watch him laboriously\\n', 'piling up strokes in the hope of giving a complete impression. You get\\n', 'none; you are lucky if, discarding two-thirds of what he gives, you can\\n', 'shape a real impression out of the rest. But with Miss Austen the\\n', 'myriad, trivial, unforced strokes build up the picture like magic.\\n', 'Nothing is false; nothing is superfluous. When (to take the present book\\n', 'only) Mr. Collins changed his mind from Jane to Elizabeth “while Mrs.\\n', 'Bennet was stirring the fire” (and we know_ how _Mrs. Bennet would have\\n', 'stirred the fire), when Mr. Darcy “brought his coffee-cup back_\\n', 'himself,” _the touch in each case is like that of Swift--“taller by the\\n', 'breadth of my nail”--which impressed the half-reluctant Thackeray with\\n', 'just and outspoken admiration. Indeed, fantastic as it may seem, I\\n', 'should put Miss Austen as near to Swift in some ways, as I have put her\\n', 'to Addison in others._\\n', '\\n', '_This Swiftian quality appears in the present novel as it appears\\n', 'nowhere else in the character of the immortal, the ineffable Mr.\\n', 'Collins. Mr. Collins is really_ great; _far greater than anything Addison\\n', 'ever did, almost great enough for Fielding or for Swift himself. It has\\n', 'been said that no one ever was like him. But in the first place,_ he\\n', '_was like him; he is there--alive, imperishable, more real than hundreds\\n', 'of prime ministers and archbishops, of “metals, semi-metals, and\\n', 'distinguished philosophers.” In the second place, it is rash, I think,\\n', 'to conclude that an actual Mr. Collins was impossible or non-existent at\\n', 'the end of the eighteenth century. It is very interesting that we\\n', 'possess, in this same gallery, what may be called a spoiled first\\n', 'draught, or an unsuccessful study of him, in John Dashwood. The\\n', 'formality, the under-breeding, the meanness, are there; but the portrait\\n', 'is only half alive, and is felt to be even a little unnatural. Mr.\\n', 'Collins is perfectly natural, and perfectly alive. In fact, for all the\\n', '“miniature,” there is something gigantic in the way in which a certain\\n', 'side, and more than one, of humanity, and especially eighteenth-century\\n', 'humanity, its Philistinism, its well-meaning but hide-bound morality,\\n', 'its formal pettiness, its grovelling respect for rank, its materialism,\\n', 'its selfishness, receives exhibition. I will not admit that one speech\\n', 'or one action of this inestimable man is incapable of being reconciled\\n', 'with reality, and I should not wonder if many of these words and actions\\n', 'are historically true._\\n', '\\n', '_But the greatness of Mr. Collins could not have been so satisfactorily\\n', 'exhibited if his creatress had not adjusted so artfully to him the\\n', 'figures of Mr. Bennet and of Lady Catherine de Bourgh. The latter, like\\n', 'Mr. Collins himself, has been charged with exaggeration. There is,\\n', 'perhaps, a very faint shade of colour for the charge; but it seems to me\\n', 'very faint indeed. Even now I do not think that it would be impossible\\n', 'to find persons, especially female persons, not necessarily of noble\\n', 'birth, as overbearing, as self-centred, as neglectful of good manners,\\n', 'as Lady Catherine. A hundred years ago, an earl’s daughter, the Lady\\n', 'Powerful (if not exactly Bountiful) of an out-of-the-way country parish,\\n', 'rich, long out of marital authority, and so forth, had opportunities of\\n', 'developing these agreeable characteristics which seldom present\\n', 'themselves now. As for Mr. Bennet, Miss Austen, and Mr. Darcy, and even\\n', 'Miss Elizabeth herself, were, I am inclined to think, rather hard on him\\n', 'for the “impropriety” of his conduct. His wife was evidently, and must\\n', 'always have been, a quite irreclaimable fool; and unless he had shot her\\n', 'or himself there was no way out of it for a man of sense and spirit but\\n', 'the ironic. From no other point of view is he open to any reproach,\\n', 'except for an excusable and not unnatural helplessness at the crisis of\\n', 'the elopement, and his utterances are the most acutely delightful in the\\n', 'consciously humorous kind--in the kind that we laugh with, not at--that\\n', 'even Miss Austen has put into the mouth of any of her characters. It is\\n', 'difficult to know whether he is most agreeable when talking to his wife,\\n', 'or when putting Mr. Collins through his paces; but the general sense of\\n', 'the world has probably been right in preferring to the first rank his\\n', 'consolation to the former when she maunders over the entail, “My dear,\\n', 'do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for better things.\\n', 'Let us flatter ourselves that_ I _may be the survivor;” and his inquiry\\n', 'to his colossal cousin as to the compliments which Mr. Collins has just\\n', 'related as made by himself to Lady Catherine, “May I ask whether these\\n', 'pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the\\n', 'result of previous study?” These are the things which give Miss Austen’s\\n', 'readers the pleasant shocks, the delightful thrills, which are felt by\\n', 'the readers of Swift, of Fielding, and we may here add, of Thackeray, as\\n', 'they are felt by the readers of no other English author of fiction\\n', 'outside of these four._\\n', '\\n', '_The goodness of the minor characters in_ Pride and Prejudice _has been\\n', 'already alluded to, and it makes a detailed dwelling on their beauties\\n', 'difficult in any space, and impossible in this. Mrs. Bennet we have\\n', 'glanced at, and it is not easy to say whether she is more exquisitely\\n', 'amusing or more horribly true. Much the same may be said of Kitty and\\n', 'Lydia; but it is not every author, even of genius, who would have\\n', 'differentiated with such unerring skill the effects of folly and\\n', 'vulgarity of intellect and disposition working upon the common\\n', 'weaknesses of woman at such different ages. With Mary, Miss Austen has\\n', 'taken rather less pains, though she has been even more unkind to her;\\n', 'not merely in the text, but, as we learn from those interesting\\n', 'traditional appendices which Mr. Austen Leigh has given us, in dooming\\n', 'her privately to marry “one of Mr. Philips’s clerks.” The habits of\\n', 'first copying and then retailing moral sentiments, of playing and\\n', 'singing too long in public, are, no doubt, grievous and criminal; but\\n', 'perhaps poor Mary was rather the scapegoat of the sins of blue stockings\\n', 'in that Fordyce-belectured generation. It is at any rate difficult not\\n', 'to extend to her a share of the respect and affection (affection and\\n', 'respect of a peculiar kind; doubtless), with which one regards Mr.\\n', 'Collins, when she draws the moral of Lydia’s fall. I sometimes wish\\n', 'that the exigencies of the story had permitted Miss Austen to unite\\n', 'these personages, and thus at once achieve a notable mating and soothe\\n', 'poor Mrs. Bennet’s anguish over the entail._\\n', '\\n', '_The Bingleys and the Gardiners and the Lucases, Miss Darcy and Miss de\\n', 'Bourgh, Jane, Wickham, and the rest, must pass without special comment,\\n', 'further than the remark that Charlotte Lucas (her egregious papa, though\\n', 'delightful, is just a little on the thither side of the line between\\n', 'comedy and farce) is a wonderfully clever study in drab of one kind, and\\n', 'that Wickham (though something of Miss Austen’s hesitation of touch in\\n', 'dealing with young men appears) is a not much less notable sketch in\\n', 'drab of another. Only genius could have made Charlotte what she is, yet\\n', 'not disagreeable; Wickham what he is, without investing him either with\\n', 'a cheap Don Juanish attractiveness or a disgusting rascality. But the\\n', 'hero and the heroine are not tints to be dismissed._\\n', '\\n', '_Darcy has always seemed to me by far the best and most interesting of\\n', 'Miss Austen’s heroes; the only possible competitor being Henry Tilney,\\n', 'whose part is so slight and simple that it hardly enters into\\n', 'comparison. It has sometimes, I believe, been urged that his pride is\\n', 'unnatural at first in its expression and later in its yielding, while\\n', 'his falling in love at all is not extremely probable. Here again I\\n', 'cannot go with the objectors. Darcy’s own account of the way in which\\n', 'his pride had been pampered, is perfectly rational and sufficient; and\\n', 'nothing could be, psychologically speaking, a_ causa verior _for its\\n', 'sudden restoration to healthy conditions than the shock of Elizabeth’s\\n', 'scornful refusal acting on a nature_ ex hypothesi _generous. Nothing in\\n', 'even our author is finer and more delicately touched than the change of\\n', 'his demeanour at the sudden meeting in the grounds of Pemberley. Had he\\n', 'been a bad prig or a bad coxcomb, he might have been still smarting\\n', 'under his rejection, or suspicious that the girl had come\\n', 'husband-hunting. His being neither is exactly consistent with the\\n', 'probable feelings of a man spoilt in the common sense, but not really\\n', 'injured in disposition, and thoroughly in love. As for his being in\\n', 'love, Elizabeth has given as just an exposition of the causes of that\\n', 'phenomenon as Darcy has of the conditions of his unregenerate state,\\n', 'only she has of course not counted in what was due to her own personal\\n', 'charm._\\n', '\\n', '_The secret of that charm many men and not a few women, from Miss Austen\\n', 'herself downwards, have felt, and like most charms it is a thing rather\\n', 'to be felt than to be explained. Elizabeth of course belongs to the_\\n', 'allegro _or_ allegra _division of the army of Venus. Miss Austen was\\n', 'always provokingly chary of description in regard to her beauties; and\\n', 'except the fine eyes, and a hint or two that she had at any rate\\n', 'sometimes a bright complexion, and was not very tall, we hear nothing\\n', 'about her looks.

Such amiable qualities must speak for\\n', 'themselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced\\n', 'only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being\\n', 'introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in\\n', 'walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.\\n', 'His character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in\\n', 'the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.\\n', 'Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of\\n', 'his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his\\n', 'having slighted one of her daughters.\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit\\n', 'down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been\\n', 'standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and\\n', 'Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his\\n', 'friend to join it.\\n', '\\n', '“Come, Darcy,” said he, “I must have you dance. I hate to see you\\n', 'standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better\\n', 'dance.”\\n', '\\n', '“I certainly shall not.

You had better return to your partner and enjoy her\\n', 'smiles, for you are wasting your time with me.”\\n', '\\n', 'Mr. Bingley followed his advice.

Jane was as much gratified by this as her\\n', 'mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane’s\\n', 'pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most\\n', 'accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been\\n', 'fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they\\n', 'had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good\\n', 'spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they\\n', 'were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With a\\n', 'book, he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a\\n', 'good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised\\n', 'such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that all his wife’s\\n', 'views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he\\n', 'had a very different story to hear.\\n', '\\n', '“Oh, my dear Mr. Bennet,” as she entered the room, “we have had a most\\n', 'delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there.\\n', 'Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well\\n', 'she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with\\n', 'her twice. Only think of _that_, my dear: he actually danced with her\\n', 'twice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second\\n', 'time. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand\\n', 'up with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody\\n', 'can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going\\n', 'down the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and\\n', 'asked her for the two next. Then, the two third he danced with Miss\\n', 'King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane\\n', 'again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the _Boulanger_----”\\n', '\\n', '“If he had had any compassion for _me_,” cried her husband impatiently,\\n', '“he would not have danced half so much! For God’s sake, say no more of\\n', 'his partners. O that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!”\\n', '\\n', '“Oh, my dear,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “I am quite delighted with him. He\\n', 'is so excessively handsome! and his sisters are charming women. I never\\n', 'in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the\\n', 'lace upon Mrs. Hurst’s gown----”\\n', '\\n', 'Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any\\n', 'description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch\\n', 'of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit, and some\\n', 'exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.\\n', '\\n', '“But I can assure you,” she added, “that Lizzy does not lose much by not\\n', 'suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at\\n', 'all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited, that there was no enduring\\n', 'him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very\\n', 'great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my\\n', 'dear, to have given him one of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.”\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration]\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'CHAPTER IV.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration]\\n', '\\n', 'When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in\\n', 'her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much\\n', 'she admired him.\\n', '\\n', '“He is just what a young-man ought to be,” said she, “sensible,\\n', 'good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners! so much ease,\\n', 'with such perfect good breeding!”\\n', '\\n', '“He is also handsome,” replied Elizabeth, “which a young man ought\\n', 'likewise to be if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete.”\\n', '\\n', '“I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I\\n', 'did not expect such a compliment.”\\n', '\\n', '“Did not you? _I_ did for you. But that is one great difference between\\n', 'us. Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never.

No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is\\n', 'very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a\\n', 'stupider person.”\\n', '\\n', '“Dear Lizzy!”\\n', '\\n', '“Oh, you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general.\\n', 'You never see a fault in anybody.

With _your_\\n', 'good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of\\n', 'others! Affectation of candour is common enough; one meets with it\\n', 'everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design,--to take the\\n', 'good of everybody’s character and make it still better, and say nothing\\n', 'of the bad,--belongs to you alone. And so, you like this man’s sisters,\\n', 'too, do you? Their manners are not equal to his.”\\n', '\\n', '“Certainly not, at first; but they are very pleasing women when you\\n', 'converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother, and keep\\n', 'his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming\\n', 'neighbour in her.”\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced: their behaviour at\\n', 'the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more\\n', 'quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and\\n', 'with a judgment, too, unassailed by any attention to herself, she was\\n', 'very little disposed to approve them. They were, in fact, very fine\\n', 'ladies; not deficient in good-humour when they were pleased, nor in the\\n', 'power of being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited.\\n', 'They were rather handsome; had been educated in one of the first private\\n', 'seminaries in town; had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds; were in the\\n', 'habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people\\n', 'of rank; and were, therefore, in every respect entitled to think well of\\n', 'themselves and meanly of others. They were of a respectable family in\\n', 'the north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their\\n', 'memories than that their brother’s fortune and their own had been\\n', 'acquired by trade.\\n', '\\n', 'Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred\\n', 'thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate,\\n', 'but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and\\n', 'sometimes made choice of his county; but, as he was now provided with a\\n', 'good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those\\n', 'who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the\\n', 'remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to\\n', 'purchase.\\n', '\\n', 'His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but\\n', 'though he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no\\n', 'means unwilling to preside at his table; nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had\\n', 'married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider\\n', 'his house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of\\n', 'age two years when he was tempted, by an accidental recommendation, to\\n', 'look at Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into it, for half an\\n', 'hour; was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied\\n', 'with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.\\n', '\\n', 'Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a\\n', 'great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the\\n', 'easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition\\n', 'could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he\\n', 'never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy’s regard, Bingley\\n', 'had the firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion. In\\n', 'understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means\\n', 'deficient; but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty,\\n', 'reserved, and fastidious; and his manners, though well bred, were not\\n', 'inviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley\\n', 'was sure of being liked wherever he appeared; Darcy was continually\\n', 'giving offence.\\n', '\\n', 'The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently\\n', 'characteristic. Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier\\n', 'girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive to him;\\n', 'there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted\\n', 'with all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel\\n', 'more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people\\n', 'in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had\\n', 'felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or\\n', 'pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty; but she smiled too\\n', 'much.\\n', '\\n', 'Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so; but still they admired\\n', 'her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom\\n', 'they should not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore\\n', 'established as a sweet girl; and their brother felt authorized by such\\n', 'commendation to think of her as he chose.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'CHAPTER V.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration]\\n', '\\n', 'Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets\\n', 'were particularly intimate.

By Jane this attention was received with the greatest\\n', 'pleasure; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of\\n', 'everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;\\n', 'though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value, as arising,\\n', 'in all probability, from the influence of their brother’s admiration. It\\n', 'was generally evident, whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; and\\n', 'to _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference\\n', 'which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a\\n', 'way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it\\n', 'was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane\\n', 'united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and an\\n', 'uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the\\n', 'suspicions of the impertinent.

My marriage had drifted us away\\n', '     from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred\\n', '     interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master\\n', '     of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention,\\n', '     while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole\\n', '     Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among\\n', '     his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and\\n', '     ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his\\n', '     own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study\\n', '     of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers\\n', '     of observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those\\n', '     mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official\\n', '     police.

As I passed the\\n', '     well-remembered door, which must always be associated in my mind with\\n', '     my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was\\n', '     seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was\\n', '     employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit,\\n', '     and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in\\n', '     a dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly,\\n', '     eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped\\n', '     behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude\\n', '     and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen\\n', '     out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new\\n', '     problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had\\n', '     formerly been in part my own.\\n', '\\n', '     His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think,\\n', '     to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved\\n', '     me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a\\n', '     spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the\\n', '     fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.\\n', '\\n', '     \"Wedlock suits you,\" he remarked. \"I think, Watson, that you have put\\n', '     on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Seven!\" I answered.\\n', '\\n', '     \"Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I\\n', '     fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me\\n', '     that you intended to go into harness.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Then, how do you know?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting\\n', '     yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and\\n', '     careless servant girl?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"My dear Holmes,\" said I, \"this is too much. You would certainly have\\n', '     been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had\\n', '     a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I\\n', \"     have changed my clothes I can't imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary\\n\", '     Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but\\n', '     there, again, I fail to see how you work it out.\"\\n', '\\n', '     He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.\\n', '\\n', '     \"It is simplicity itself,\" said he; \"my eyes tell me that on the\\n', '     inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the\\n', '     leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts.

Hence, you\\n', '     see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and\\n', '     that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the\\n', '     London slavey.

And yet I believe that my eyes are as good as yours.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Quite so,\" he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself\\n', '     down into an armchair. \"You see, but you do not observe.

Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have\\n', '     both seen and observed. By-the-way, since you are interested in these\\n', '     little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or\\n', '     two of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.\" He\\n', '     threw over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted note-paper which had been\\n', '     lying open upon the table. \"It came by the last post,\" said he. \"Read\\n', '     it aloud.\"\\n', '\\n', '     The note was undated, and without either signature or address.\\n', '\\n', '     \"There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o\\'clock,\"\\n', '     it said, \"a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the\\n', '     very deepest moment.

His dress\\n', '     was rich with a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as\\n', '     akin to bad taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the\\n', '     sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue\\n', '     cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with\\n', '     flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch which\\n', '     consisted of a single flaming beryl. Boots which extended halfway up\\n', '     his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur,\\n', '     completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by\\n', '     his whole appearance. He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand,\\n', '     while he wore across the upper part of his face, extending down past\\n', '     the cheekbones, a black vizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted\\n', '     that very moment, for his hand was still raised to it as he entered.\\n', '     From the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong\\n', '     character, with a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight chin\\n', '     suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy.\\n', '\\n', '     \"You had my note?\" he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly\\n', '     marked German accent. \"I told you that I would call.\" He looked from\\n', '     one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.\\n', '\\n', '     \"Pray take a seat,\" said Holmes. \"This is my friend and colleague,\\n', '     Dr. Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases.\\n', '     Whom have I the honour to address?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman.

To speak\\n', '     plainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein,\\n', '     hereditary kings of Bohemia.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"I was also aware of that,\" murmured Holmes, settling himself down in\\n', '     his armchair and closing his eyes.\\n', '\\n', '     Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid,\\n', '     lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as\\n', '     the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes\\n', '     slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic\\n', '     client.\\n', '\\n', '     \"If your Majesty would condescend to state your case,\" he remarked,\\n', '     \"I should be better able to advise you.\"\\n', '\\n', '     The man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in\\n', '     uncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he\\n', '     tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. \"You are\\n', '     right,\" he cried; \"I am the King. Why should I attempt to conceal\\n', '     it?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Why, indeed?\" murmured Holmes. \"Your Majesty had not spoken before I\\n', '     was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von\\n', '     Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary King of\\n', '     Bohemia.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"But you can understand,\" said our strange visitor, sitting down once\\n', '     more and passing his hand over his high white forehead, \"you can\\n', '     understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own\\n', '     person. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to\\n', '     an agent without putting myself in his power. I have come incognito\\n', '     from Prague for the purpose of consulting you.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Then, pray consult,\" said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.\\n', '\\n', '     \"The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy\\n', '     visit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known\\n', '     adventuress, Irene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to you.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor,\" murmured Holmes without\\n', '     opening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of docketing\\n', '     all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to\\n', '     name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish\\n', '     information. In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between\\n', '     that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written\\n', '     a monograph upon the deep-sea fishes.\\n', '\\n', '     \"Let me see!\" said Holmes. \"Hum! Born in New Jersey in the year 1858.\\n', '     Contralto--hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of\\n', '     Warsaw--yes! Retired from operatic stage--ha! Living in London--quite\\n', '     so! Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young\\n', '     person, wrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of\\n', '     getting those letters back.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Precisely so. But how--\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Was there a secret marriage?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"None.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"No legal papers or certificates?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"None.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Then I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should\\n', '     produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to\\n', '     prove their authenticity?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"There is the writing.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Pooh, pooh! Forgery.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"My private note-paper.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Stolen.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"My own seal.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Imitated.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"My photograph.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Bought.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"We were both in the photograph.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Oh, dear!

Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her\\n', '     house. Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. Twice she has\\n', '     been waylaid. There has been no result.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"No sign of it?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Absolutely none.\"\\n', '\\n', '     Holmes laughed. \"It is quite a pretty little problem,\" said he.\\n', '\\n', '     \"But a very serious one to me,\" returned the King reproachfully.\\n', '\\n', '     \"Very, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the photograph?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"To ruin me.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"But how?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"I am about to be married.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"So I have heard.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the King\\n', '     of Scandinavia. You may know the strict principles of her family. She\\n', '     is herself the very soul of delicacy.

She has the face of the most beautiful of women, and the mind\\n', '     of the most resolute of men. Rather than I should marry another\\n', '     woman, there are no lengths to which she would not go--none.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"You are sure that she has not sent it yet?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"I am sure.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"And why?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the\\n', '     betrothal was publicly proclaimed.

Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London\\n', '     for the present?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Certainly. You will find me at the Langham under the name of the\\n', '     Count Von Kramm.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Pray do so.

And good-night, Watson,\" he added, as the\\n', '     wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. \"If you will be\\n', \"     good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three o'clock I should\\n\", '     like to chat this little matter over with you.\"\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '          CHAPTER II\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', \"     At three o'clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had not\\n\", '     yet returned. The landlady informed me that he had left the house\\n', \"     shortly after eight o'clock in the morning. I sat down beside the\\n\", '     fire, however, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he\\n', '     might be. I was already deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though\\n', '     it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were\\n', '     associated with the two crimes which I have already recorded, still,\\n', '     the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it\\n', '     a character of its own. Indeed, apart from the nature of the\\n', '     investigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his\\n', '     masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning,\\n', '     which made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to\\n', '     follow the quick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most\\n', '     inextricable mysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable success\\n', '     that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my\\n', '     head.\\n', '\\n', '     It was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking\\n', '     groom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and\\n', '     disreputable clothes, walked into the room. Accustomed as I was to my\\n', \"     friend's amazing powers in the use of disguises, I had to look three\\n\", '     times before I was certain that it was indeed he. With a nod he\\n', '     vanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes\\n', '     tweed-suited and respectable, as of old. Putting his hands into his\\n', '     pockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed\\n', '     heartily for some minutes.\\n', '\\n', '     \"Well, really!\" he cried, and then he choked and laughed again until\\n', '     he was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the chair.\\n', '\\n', '     \"What is it?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"It\\'s quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I employed\\n', '     my morning, or what I ended by doing.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"I can\\'t imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the habits,\\n', '     and perhaps the house, of Miss Irene Adler.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you,\\n', \"     however. I left the house a little after eight o'clock this morning\\n\", '     in the character of a groom out of work. There is a wonderful\\n', '     sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men. Be one of them, and you\\n', '     will know all that there is to know. I soon found Briony Lodge. It is\\n', '     a bijou villa, with a garden at the back, but built out in front\\n', '     right up to the road, two stories. Chubb lock to the door. Large\\n', '     sitting-room on the right side, well furnished, with long windows\\n', '     almost to the floor, and those preposterous English window fasteners\\n', '     which a child could open. Behind there was nothing remarkable, save\\n', '     that the passage window could be reached from the top of the\\n', '     coach-house. I walked round it and examined it closely from every\\n', '     point of view, but without noting anything else of interest.\\n', '\\n', '     \"I then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that there\\n', '     was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden. I\\n', '     lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, and received in\\n', '     exchange twopence, a glass of half and half, two fills of shag\\n', '     tobacco, and as much information as I could desire about Miss Adler,\\n', '     to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in\\n', '     whom I was not in the least interested, but whose biographies I was\\n', '     compelled to listen to.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"And what of Irene Adler?\" I asked.\\n', '\\n', '     \"Oh, she has turned all the men\\'s heads down in that part. She is the\\n', '     daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the\\n', '     Serpentine-mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts,\\n', '     drives out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner.\\n', '     Seldom goes out at other times, except when she sings. Has only one\\n', '     male visitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark, handsome, and\\n', '     dashing, never calls less than once a day, and often twice. He is a\\n', '     Mr. Godfrey Norton, of the Inner Temple. See the advantages of a\\n', '     cabman as a confidant. They had driven him home a dozen times from\\n', '     Serpentine-mews, and knew all about him. When I had listened to all\\n', '     they had to tell, I began to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once\\n', '     more, and to think over my plan of campaign.\\n', '\\n', '     \"This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter.\\n', '     He was a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the relation between\\n', '     them, and what the object of his repeated visits? Was she his client,\\n', '     his friend, or his mistress? If the former, she had probably\\n', '     transferred the photograph to his keeping. If the latter, it was less\\n', '     likely. On the issue of this question depended whether I should\\n', '     continue my work at Briony Lodge, or turn my attention to the\\n', \"     gentleman's chambers in the Temple. It was a delicate point, and it\\n\", '     widened the field of my inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these\\n', '     details, but I have to let you see my little difficulties, if you are\\n', '     to understand the situation.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"I am following you closely,\" I answered.\\n', '\\n', '     \"I was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove\\n', '     up to Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. He was a remarkably\\n', '     handsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached--evidently the man of\\n', '     whom I had heard. He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the\\n', '     cabman to wait, and brushed past the maid who opened the door with\\n', '     the air of a man who was thoroughly at home.\\n', '\\n', '     \"He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses\\n', '     of him in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and down,\\n', '     talking excitedly, and waving his arms. Of her I could see nothing.\\n', '     Presently he emerged, looking even more flurried than before. As he\\n', '     stepped up to the cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and\\n', \"     looked at it earnestly, 'Drive like the devil,' he shouted, 'first to\\n\", \"     Gross & Hankey's in Regent Street, and then to the Church of St.\\n\", '     Monica in the Edgeware Road. Half a guinea if you do it in twenty\\n', \"     minutes!'\\n\", '\\n', '     \"Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do\\n', '     well to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau, the\\n', '     coachman with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear,\\n', '     while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles.\\n', \"     It hadn't pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it.\\n\", '     I only caught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was a lovely\\n', '     woman, with a face that a man might die for.\\n', '\\n', '     \"\\'The Church of St. Monica, John,\\' she cried, \\'and half a sovereign\\n', \"     if you reach it in twenty minutes.'\\n\", '\\n', '     \"This was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was just balancing\\n', '     whether I should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her\\n', '     landau when a cab came through the street. The driver looked twice at\\n', \"     such a shabby fare, but I jumped in before he could object. 'The\\n\", \"     Church of St. Monica,' said I, 'and half a sovereign if you reach it\\n\", \"     in twenty minutes.' It was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of\\n\", '     course it was clear enough what was in the wind.\\n', '\\n', '     \"My cabby drove fast. I don\\'t think I ever drove faster, but the\\n', '     others were there before us. The cab and the landau with their\\n', '     steaming horses were in front of the door when I arrived. I paid the\\n', '     man and hurried into the church. There was not a soul there save the\\n', '     two whom I had followed and a surpliced clergyman, who seemed to be\\n', '     expostulating with them. They were all three standing in a knot in\\n', '     front of the altar. I lounged up the side aisle like any other idler\\n', '     who has dropped into a church. Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at\\n', '     the altar faced round to me, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard\\n', '     as he could towards me.\\n', '\\n', '     \"\\'Thank God,\\' he cried. \\'You\\'ll do. Come! Come!\\'\\n', '\\n', '     \"\\'What then?\\' I asked.\\n', '\\n', '     \"\\'Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won\\'t be legal.\\'\\n', '\\n', '     \"I was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was I\\n', '     found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear, and\\n', '     vouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally assisting\\n', '     in the secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to Godfrey Norton,\\n', '     bachelor. It was all done in an instant, and there was the gentleman\\n', '     thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other, while the\\n', '     clergyman beamed on me in front. It was the most preposterous\\n', '     position in which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the\\n', '     thought of it that started me laughing just now. It seems that there\\n', '     had been some informality about their license, that the clergyman\\n', '     absolutely refused to marry them without a witness of some sort, and\\n', '     that my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally\\n', '     out into the streets in search of a best man. The bride gave me a\\n', '     sovereign, and I mean to wear it on my watch-chain in memory of the\\n', '     occasion.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"This is a very unexpected turn of affairs,\" said I; \"and what then?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Well, I found my plans very seriously menaced. It looked as if the\\n', '     pair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate very\\n', '     prompt and energetic measures on my part. At the church door,\\n', '     however, they separated, he driving back to the Temple, and she to\\n', \"     her own house. 'I shall drive out in the park at five as usual,' she\\n\", '     said as she left him. I heard no more. They drove away in different\\n', '     directions, and I went off to make my own arrangements.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Which are?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Some cold beef and a glass of beer,\" he answered, ringing the bell.\\n', '     \"I have been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to be busier\\n', '     still this evening. By the way, Doctor, I shall want your\\n', '     co-operation.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"I shall be delighted.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"You don\\'t mind breaking the law?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Not in the least.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Nor running a chance of arrest?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Not in a good cause.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Oh, the cause is excellent!\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Then I am your man.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"I was sure that I might rely on you.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"But what is it you wish?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to\\n', '     you. Now,\" he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our\\n', '     landlady had provided, \"I must discuss it while I eat, for I have not\\n', '     much time. It is nearly five now. In two hours we must be on the\\n', '     scene of action. Miss Irene, or Madame, rather, returns from her\\n', '     drive at seven. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"And what then?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"You must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is to occur.\\n', '     There is only one point on which I must insist. You must not\\n', '     interfere, come what may. You understand?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"I am to be neutral?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"To do nothing whatever. There will probably be some small\\n', '     unpleasantness. Do not join in it.

You are to station yourself close to that open\\n', '     window.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Yes.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Yes.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"And when I raise my hand--so--you will throw into the room what I\\n', '     give you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of fire.\\n', '     You quite follow me?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Entirely.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"It is nothing very formidable,\" he said, taking a long cigar-shaped\\n', '     roll from his pocket. \"It is an ordinary plumber\\'s smoke-rocket,\\n', '     fitted with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting. Your task\\n', '     is confined to that. When you raise your cry of fire, it will be\\n', '     taken up by quite a number of people. You may then walk to the end of\\n', '     the street, and I will rejoin you in ten minutes. I hope that I have\\n', '     made myself clear?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"I am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and at\\n', '     the signal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry of fire,\\n', '     and to wait you at the corner of the street.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Precisely.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Then you may entirely rely on me.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"That is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I\\n', '     prepare for the new role I have to play.\"\\n', '\\n', '     He disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the\\n', '     character of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman.\\n', '     His broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his\\n', '     sympathetic smile, and general look of peering and benevolent\\n', '     curiosity were such as Mr. John Hare alone could have equalled. It\\n', '     was not merely that Holmes changed his costume. His expression, his\\n', '     manner, his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh part that he\\n', '     assumed. The stage lost a fine actor, even as science lost an acute\\n', '     reasoner, when he became a specialist in crime.\\n', '\\n', '     It was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still\\n', '     wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine\\n', '     Avenue. It was already dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as\\n', '     we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming\\n', '     of its occupant. The house was just such as I had pictured it from\\n', \"     Sherlock Holmes' succinct description, but the locality appeared to\\n\", '     be less private than I expected. On the contrary, for a small street\\n', '     in a quiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably animated. There was a\\n', '     group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner, a\\n', '     scissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with\\n', '     a nurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up\\n', '     and down with cigars in their mouths.\\n', '\\n', '     \"You see,\" remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the\\n', '     house, \"this marriage rather simplifies matters. The photograph\\n', '     becomes a double-edged weapon now. The chances are that she would be\\n', '     as averse to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is\\n', '     to its coming to the eyes of his princess. Now the question is--Where\\n', '     are we to find the photograph?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Where, indeed?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is\\n', \"     cabinet size. Too large for easy concealment about a woman's dress.\\n\", '     She knows that the King is capable of having her waylaid and\\n', '     searched. Two attempts of the sort have already been made. We may\\n', '     take it, then, that she does not carry it about with her.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Where, then?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Her banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But I am\\n', '     inclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive, and they\\n', '     like to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it over to anyone\\n', '     else? She could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell\\n', '     what indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a\\n', '     business man. Besides, remember that she had resolved to use it\\n', '     within a few days. It must be where she can lay her hands upon it. It\\n', '     must be in her own house.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"But it has twice been burgled.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Pshaw! They did not know how to look.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"But how will you look?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"I will not look.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"What then?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"I will get her to show me.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"But she will refuse.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is her\\n', '     carriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter.\"\\n', '\\n', '     As he spoke the gleam of the side-lights of a carriage came round the\\n', '     curve of the avenue. It was a smart little landau which rattled up to\\n', '     the door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of the loafing men at\\n', '     the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a\\n', '     copper, but was elbowed away by another loafer, who had rushed up\\n', '     with the same intention. A fierce quarrel broke out, which was\\n', '     increased by the two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the\\n', '     loungers, and by the scissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the\\n', '     other side. A blow was struck, and in an instant the lady, who had\\n', '     stepped from her carriage, was the centre of a little knot of flushed\\n', '     and struggling men, who struck savagely at each other with their\\n', '     fists and sticks. Holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the lady;\\n', '     but just as he reached her he gave a cry and dropped to the ground,\\n', '     with the blood running freely down his face. At his fall the\\n', '     guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in\\n', '     the other, while a number of better-dressed people, who had watched\\n', '     the scuffle without taking part in it, crowded in to help the lady\\n', '     and to attend to the injured man. Irene Adler, as I will still call\\n', '     her, had hurried up the steps; but she stood at the top with her\\n', '     superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall, looking back\\n', '     into the street.\\n', '\\n', '     \"Is the poor gentleman much hurt?\" she asked.\\n', '\\n', '     \"He is dead,\" cried several voices.\\n', '\\n', '     \"No, no, there\\'s life in him!\" shouted another. \"But he\\'ll be gone\\n', '     before you can get him to hospital.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"He\\'s a brave fellow,\" said a woman. \"They would have had the lady\\'s\\n', \"     purse and watch if it hadn't been for him. They were a gang, and a\\n\", '     rough one, too. Ah, he\\'s breathing now.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"He can\\'t lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Surely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable\\n', '     sofa. This way, please!\"\\n', '\\n', '     Slowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in\\n', '     the principal room, while I still observed the proceedings from my\\n', '     post by the window. The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not\\n', '     been drawn, so that I could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch. I do\\n', '     not know whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for\\n', '     the part he was playing, but I know that I never felt more heartily\\n', '     ashamed of myself in my life than when I saw the beautiful creature\\n', '     against whom I was conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which\\n', '     she waited upon the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest\\n', '     treachery to Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had\\n', '     intrusted to me. I hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from\\n', '     under my ulster. After all, I thought, we are not injuring her. We\\n', '     are but preventing her from injuring another.\\n', '\\n', '     Holmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who\\n', '     is in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the window. At\\n', '     the same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the signal I tossed\\n', '     my rocket into the room with a cry of \"Fire!\" The word was no sooner\\n', '     out of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and\\n', '     ill--gentlemen, ostlers, and servant-maids--joined in a general\\n', '     shriek of \"Fire!\" Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and\\n', '     out at the open window. I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a\\n', '     moment later the voice of Holmes from within assuring them that it\\n', '     was a false alarm. Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way\\n', '     to the corner of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find\\n', \"     my friend's arm in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar. He\\n\", '     walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we had\\n', '     turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the Edgeware\\n', '     Road.\\n', '\\n', '     \"You did it very nicely, Doctor,\" he remarked. \"Nothing could have\\n', '     been better. It is all right.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"You have the photograph?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"I know where it is.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"And how did you find out?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"She showed me, as I told you she would.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"I am still in the dark.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"I do not wish to make a mystery,\" said he, laughing. \"The matter was\\n', '     perfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the street was\\n', '     an accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"I guessed as much.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the\\n', '     palm of my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my\\n', '     face, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"That also I could fathom.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else\\n', '     could she do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room\\n', '     which I suspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was\\n', '     determined to see which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air,\\n', '     they were compelled to open the window, and you had your chance.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"How did that help you?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"It was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on fire,\\n', '     her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most.\\n', '     It is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once\\n', '     taken advantage of it. In the case of the Darlington substitution\\n', '     scandal it was of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle\\n', '     business. A married woman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches\\n', '     for her jewel-box. Now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had\\n', '     nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest\\n', '     of. She would rush to secure it. The alarm of fire was admirably\\n', '     done. The smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel.\\n', '     She responded beautifully. The photograph is in a recess behind a\\n', '     sliding panel just above the right bell-pull. She was there in an\\n', '     instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as she half-drew it out. When I\\n', '     cried out that it was a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at the\\n', '     rocket, rushed from the room, and I have not seen her since. I rose,\\n', '     and, making my excuses, escaped from the house. I hesitated whether\\n', '     to attempt to secure the photograph at once; but the coachman had\\n', '     come in, and as he was watching me narrowly it seemed safer to wait.\\n', '     A little over-precipitance may ruin all.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"And now?\" I asked.\\n', '\\n', '     \"Our quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King\\n', '     to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will be\\n', '     shown into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable\\n', '     that when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph. It\\n', '     might be a satisfaction to his Majesty to regain it with his own\\n', '     hands.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"And when will you call?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"At eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall have a\\n', '     clear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a\\n', '     complete change in her life and habits. I must wire to the King\\n', '     without delay.\"\\n', '\\n', '     We had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door. He was\\n', '     searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said:\\n', '\\n', '     \"Good-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes.\"\\n', '\\n', '     There were several people on the pavement at the time, but the\\n', '     greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had\\n', '     hurried by.\\n', '\\n', '     \"I\\'ve heard that voice before,\" said Holmes, staring down the dimly\\n', '     lit street. \"Now, I wonder who the deuce that could have been.\"\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '          CHAPTER III\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '     I slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our\\n', '     toast and coffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed into\\n', '     the room.\\n', '\\n', '     \"You have really got it!\" he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by\\n', '     either shoulder and looking eagerly into his face.\\n', '\\n', '     \"Not yet.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"But you have hopes?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"I have hopes.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Then, come. I am all impatience to be gone.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"We must have a cab.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"No, my brougham is waiting.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Then that will simplify matters.\" We descended and started off once\\n', '     more for Briony Lodge.\\n', '\\n', '     \"Irene Adler is married,\" remarked Holmes.\\n', '\\n', '     \"Married! When?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Yesterday.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"But to whom?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"To an English lawyer named Norton.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"But she could not love him.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"I am in hopes that she does.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"And why in hopes?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Because it would spare your Majesty all fear of future annoyance. If\\n', '     the lady loves her husband, she does not love your Majesty. If she\\n', '     does not love your Majesty, there is no reason why she should\\n', '     interfere with your Majesty\\'s plan.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"It is true. And yet--Well! I wish she had been of my own station!\\n', '     What a queen she would have made!\" He relapsed into a moody silence,\\n', '     which was not broken until we drew up in Serpentine Avenue.\\n', '\\n', '     The door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood upon\\n', '     the steps. She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the\\n', '     brougham.\\n', '\\n', '     \"Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?\" said she.\\n', '\\n', '     \"I am Mr. Holmes,\" answered my companion, looking at her with a\\n', '     questioning and rather startled gaze.\\n', '\\n', '     \"Indeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call. She left\\n', '     this morning with her husband by the 5.15 train from Charing Cross\\n', '     for the Continent.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"What!\" Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and\\n', '     surprise. \"Do you mean that she has left England?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Never to return.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"And the papers?\" asked the King hoarsely. \"All is lost.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"We shall see.\" He pushed past the servant and rushed into the\\n', '     drawing-room, followed by the King and myself. The furniture was\\n', '     scattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and open\\n', '     drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her\\n', '     flight. Holmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small sliding\\n', '     shutter, and, plunging in his hand, pulled out a photograph and a\\n', '     letter. The photograph was of Irene Adler herself in evening dress,\\n', '     the letter was superscribed to \"Sherlock Holmes, Esq. To be left till\\n', '     called for.\" My friend tore it open and we all three read it\\n', '     together. It was dated at midnight of the preceding night and ran in\\n', '     this way:\\n', '\\n', '     \"My dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes:\\n', '     \"You really did it very well. You took me in completely. Until after\\n', '     the alarm of fire, I had not a suspicion. But then, when I found how\\n', '     I had betrayed myself, I began to think. I had been warned against\\n', '     you months ago. I had been told that if the King employed an agent it\\n', '     would certainly be you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with\\n', '     all this, you made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I\\n', '     became suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind\\n', '     old clergyman. But, you know, I have been trained as an actress\\n', '     myself. Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take advantage of\\n', '     the freedom which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to watch you,\\n', '     ran up stairs, got into my walking-clothes, as I call them, and came\\n', '     down just as you departed.\\n', '     \"Well, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was\\n', '     really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock Holmes.\\n', '     Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and started for\\n', '     the Temple to see my husband.\\n', '     \"We both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by so\\n', '     formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when you\\n', '     call to-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may rest in peace.\\n', '     I love and am loved by a better man than he. The King may do what he\\n', '     will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly wronged. I keep\\n', '     it only to safeguard myself, and to preserve a weapon which will\\n', '     always secure me from any steps which he might take in the future. I\\n', '     leave a photograph which he might care to possess; and I remain, dear\\n', '     Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\\n', '     \"Very truly yours,\\n', '     \"Irene Norton, nÃ©e Adler.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"What a woman--oh, what a woman!\" cried the King of Bohemia, when we\\n', '     had all three read this epistle. \"Did I not tell you how quick and\\n', '     resolute she was? Would she not have made an admirable queen? Is it\\n', '     not a pity that she was not on my level?\" \\n', '\\n', '     \"From what I have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on a very\\n', '     different level to your Majesty,\" said Holmes coldly. \"I am sorry\\n', \"     that I have not been able to bring your Majesty's business to a more\\n\", '     successful conclusion.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"On the contrary, my dear sir,\" cried the King; \"nothing could be\\n', '     more successful. I know that her word is inviolate. The photograph is\\n', '     now as safe as if it were in the fire.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"I am glad to hear your Majesty say so.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"I am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can\\n', '     reward you. This ring--\" He slipped an emerald snake ring from his\\n', '     finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand.\\n', '\\n', '     \"Your Majesty has something which I should value even more highly,\"\\n', '     said Holmes.\\n', '\\n', '     \"You have but to name it.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"This photograph!\"\\n', '\\n', '     The King stared at him in amazement.\\n', '\\n', '     \"Irene\\'s photograph!\" he cried. \"Certainly, if you wish it.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"I thank your Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the\\n', '     matter. I have the honour to wish you a very good-morning.\" He bowed,\\n', '     and, turning away without observing the hand which the King had\\n', '     stretched out to him, he set off in my company for his chambers.\\n', '\\n', '     And that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of\\n', '     Bohemia, and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by\\n', \"     a woman's wit. He used to make merry over the cleverness of women,\\n\", '     but I have not heard him do it of late. And when he speaks of Irene\\n', '     Adler, or when he refers to her photograph, it is always under the\\n', '     honourable title of the woman.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '                              THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE\\n', '\\n', '     I had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the\\n', '     autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a very\\n', '     stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair. With an\\n', '     apology for my intrusion, I was about to withdraw when Holmes pulled\\n', '     me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me.\\n', '\\n', '     \"You could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear Watson,\"\\n', '     he said cordially.\\n', '\\n', '     \"I was afraid that you were engaged.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"So I am. Very much so.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Then I can wait in the next room.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Not at all.

You have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has\\n', '     prompted you to chronicle, and, if you will excuse my saying so,\\n', '     somewhat to embellish so many of my own little adventures.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me,\" I\\n', '     observed.\\n', '\\n', '     \"You will remember that I remarked the other day, just before we went\\n', '     into the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland, that\\n', '     for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life\\n', '     itself, which is always far more daring than any effort of the\\n', '     imagination.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"A proposition which I took the liberty of doubting.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"You did, Doctor, but none the less you must come round to my view,\\n', '     for otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your\\n', '     reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right. Now,\\n', '     Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this\\n', '     morning, and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the\\n', '     most singular which I have listened to for some time. You have heard\\n', '     me remark that the strangest and most unique things are very often\\n', '     connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimes, and\\n', '     occasionally, indeed, where there is room for doubt whether any\\n', '     positive crime has been committed. As far as I have heard it is\\n', '     impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of\\n', '     crime or not, but the course of events is certainly among the most\\n', '     singular that I have ever listened to. Perhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would\\n', '     have the great kindness to recommence your narrative. I ask you not\\n', '     merely because my friend Dr. Watson has not heard the opening part\\n', '     but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to\\n', '     have every possible detail from your lips. As a rule, when I have\\n', '     heard some slight indication of the course of events, I am able to\\n', '     guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to\\n', '     my memory. In the present instance I am forced to admit that the\\n', '     facts are, to the best of my belief, unique.\"\\n', '\\n', '     The portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some\\n', '     little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the\\n', '     inside pocket of his greatcoat. As he glanced down the advertisement\\n', '     column, with his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon\\n', '     his knee, I took a good look at the man and endeavoured, after the\\n', '     fashion of my companion, to read the indications which might be\\n', '     presented by his dress or appearance.\\n', '\\n', '     I did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our visitor bore\\n', '     every mark of being an average commonplace British tradesman, obese,\\n', \"     pompous, and slow. He wore rather baggy grey shepherd's check\\n\", '     trousers, a not over-clean black frock-coat, unbuttoned in the front,\\n', '     and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain, and a square\\n', '     pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament. A frayed top-hat\\n', '     and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a\\n', '     chair beside him. Altogether, look as I would, there was nothing\\n', '     remarkable about the man save his blazing red head, and the\\n', '     expression of extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features.\\n', '\\n', \"     Sherlock Holmes' quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his\\n\", '     head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances. \"Beyond the\\n', '     obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour, that he\\n', '     takes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has been in China, and\\n', '     that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately, I can\\n', '     deduce nothing else.\"\\n', '\\n', '     Mr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon\\n', '     the paper, but his eyes upon my companion.\\n', '\\n', '     \"How, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr.\\n', '     Holmes?\" he asked. \"How did you know, for example, that I did manual\\n', '     labour. It\\'s as true as gospel, for I began as a ship\\'s carpenter.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Your hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size larger than\\n', '     your left. You have worked with it, and the muscles are more\\n', '     developed.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"I won\\'t insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that,\\n', '     especially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you use\\n', '     an arc-and-compass breastpin.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Ah, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five\\n', '     inches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where\\n', '     you rest it upon the desk?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Well, but China?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist\\n', '     could only have been done in China. I have made a small study of\\n', '     tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the\\n', \"     subject.

When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin\\n', '     hanging from your watch-chain, the matter becomes even more simple.\"\\n', '\\n', '     Mr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. \"Well, I never!\" said he. \"I\\n', '     thought at first that you had done something clever, but I see that\\n', '     there was nothing in it, after all.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"I begin to think, Watson,\" said Holmes, \"that I make a mistake in\\n', \"     explaining.

Can you not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Yes, I have got it now,\" he answered with his thick red finger\\n', '     planted halfway down the column. \"Here it is.

Now, Mr. Wilson?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Well, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\"\\n', '     said Jabez Wilson, mopping his forehead; \"I have a small pawnbroker\\'s\\n', \"     business at Coburg Square, near the City. It's not a very large\\n\", '     affair, and of late years it has not done more than just give me a\\n', '     living. I used to be able to keep two assistants, but now I only keep\\n', '     one; and I would have a job to pay him but that he is willing to come\\n', '     for half wages so as to learn the business.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"What is the name of this obliging youth?\" asked Sherlock Holmes.\\n', '\\n', '     \"His name is Vincent Spaulding, and he\\'s not such a youth, either.\\n', \"     It's hard to say his age. I should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr.\\n\", '     Holmes; and I know very well that he could better himself and earn\\n', '     twice what I am able to give him. But, after all, if he is satisfied,\\n', '     why should I put ideas in his head?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Why, indeed? You seem most fortunate in having an employee who comes\\n', '     under the full market price. It is not a common experience among\\n', \"     employers in this age.

Snapping away with a camera when he ought to\\n', '     be improving his mind, and then diving down into the cellar like a\\n', '     rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures. That is his main fault,\\n', '     but on the whole he\\'s a good worker. There\\'s no vice in him.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"He is still with you, I presume?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Yes, sir. He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple\\n', \"     cooking and keeps the place clean--that's all I have in the house,\\n\", '     for I am a widower and never had any family. We live very quietly,\\n', '     sir, the three of us; and we keep a roof over our heads and pay our\\n', '     debts, if we do nothing more.\\n', '\\n', '     \"The first thing that put us out was that advertisement. Spaulding,\\n', '     he came down into the office just this day eight weeks, with this\\n', '     very paper in his hand, and he says:\\n', '\\n', '     \"\\'I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.\\'\\n', '\\n', '     \"\\'Why that?\\' I asks.\\n', '\\n', '     \"\\'Why,\\' says he, \\'here\\'s another vacancy on the League of the\\n', \"     Red-headed Men. It's worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets\\n\", '     it, and I understand that there are more vacancies than there are\\n', \"     men, so that the trustees are at their wits' end what to do with the\\n\", \"     money. If my hair would only change colour, here's a nice little crib\\n\", \"     all ready for me to step into.'\\n\", '\\n', '     \"\\'Why, what is it, then?\\' I asked. You see, Mr. Holmes, I am a very\\n', '     stay-at-home man, and as my business came to me instead of my having\\n', '     to go to it, I was often weeks on end without putting my foot over\\n', \"     the door-mat. In that way I didn't know much of what was going on\\n\", '     outside, and I was always glad of a bit of news.\\n', '\\n', '     \"\\'Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men?\\' he asked\\n', '     with his eyes open.\\n', '\\n', '     \"\\'Never.\\'\\n', '\\n', '     \"\\'Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one of the\\n', \"     vacancies.'\\n\", '\\n', '     \"\\'And what are they worth?\\' I asked.\\n', '\\n', '     \"\\'Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight, and\\n', \"     it need not interfere very much with one's other occupations.'\\n\", '\\n', '     \"Well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears, for\\n', '     the business has not been over-good for some years, and an extra\\n', '     couple of hundred would have been very handy.\\n', '\\n', '     \"\\'Tell me all about it,\\' said I.\\n', '\\n', '     \"\\'Well,\\' said he, showing me the advertisement, \\'you can see for\\n', '     yourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the address\\n', '     where you should apply for particulars. As far as I can make out, the\\n', '     League was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah Hopkins, who\\n', '     was very peculiar in his ways. He was himself red-headed, and he had\\n', '     a great sympathy for all red-headed men; so when he died it was found\\n', '     that he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees, with\\n', '     instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to\\n', '     men whose hair is of that colour. From all I hear it is splendid pay\\n', \"     and very little to do.'\\n\", '\\n', '     \"\\'But,\\' said I, \\'there would be millions of red-headed men who would\\n', \"     apply.'\\n\", '\\n', '     \"\\'Not so many as you might think,\\' he answered. \\'You see it is really\\n', '     confined to Londoners, and to grown men. This American had started\\n', '     from London when he was young, and he wanted to do the old town a\\n', '     good turn. Then, again, I have heard it is no use your applying if\\n', '     your hair is light red, or dark red, or anything but real bright,\\n', '     blazing, fiery red. Now, if you cared to apply, Mr. Wilson, you would\\n', '     just walk in; but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put\\n', \"     yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds.'\\n\", '\\n', '     \"Now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, that my\\n', '     hair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to me that if\\n', '     there was to be any competition in the matter I stood as good a\\n', '     chance as any man that I had ever met. Vincent Spaulding seemed to\\n', '     know so much about it that I thought he might prove useful, so I just\\n', '     ordered him to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away\\n', '     with me. He was very willing to have a holiday, so we shut the\\n', '     business up and started off for the address that was given us in the\\n', '     advertisement.\\n', '\\n', '     \"I never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes. From\\n', '     north, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in his\\n', '     hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement. Fleet\\n', \"     Street was choked with red-headed folk, and Pope's Court looked like\\n\", \"     a coster's orange barrow. I should not have thought there were so\\n\", '     many in the whole country as were brought together by that single\\n', '     advertisement. Every shade of colour they were--straw, lemon, orange,\\n', '     brick, Irish-setter, liver, clay; but, as Spaulding said, there were\\n', '     not many who had the real vivid flame-coloured tint. When I saw how\\n', '     many were waiting, I would have given it up in despair; but Spaulding\\n', '     would not hear of it. How he did it I could not imagine, but he\\n', '     pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and\\n', '     right up to the steps which led to the office. There was a double\\n', '     stream upon the stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back\\n', '     dejected; but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found\\n', '     ourselves in the office.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Your experience has been a most entertaining one,\" remarked Holmes\\n', '     as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of\\n', '     snuff. \"Pray continue your very interesting statement.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a\\n', '     deal table, behind which sat a small man with a head that was even\\n', '     redder than mine. He said a few words to each candidate as he came\\n', '     up, and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would\\n', '     disqualify them. Getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very\\n', '     easy matter, after all. However, when our turn came the little man\\n', '     was much more favourable to me than to any of the others, and he\\n', '     closed the door as we entered, so that he might have a private word\\n', '     with us.\\n', '\\n', '     \"\\'This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,\\' said my assistant, \\'and he is willing to\\n', \"     fill a vacancy in the League.'\\n\", '\\n', '     \"\\'And he is admirably suited for it,\\' the other answered. \\'He has\\n', '     every requirement. I cannot recall when I have seen anything so\\n', \"     fine.' He took a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and\\n\", '     gazed at my hair until I felt quite bashful. Then suddenly he plunged\\n', '     forward, wrung my hand, and congratulated me warmly on my success.\\n', '\\n', '     \"\\'It would be injustice to hesitate,\\' said he. \\'You will, however, I\\n', \"     am sure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.' With that he\\n\", '     seized my hair in both his hands, and tugged until I yelled with the\\n', \"     pain. 'There is water in your eyes,' said he as he released me. 'I\\n\", '     perceive that all is as it should be. But we have to be careful, for\\n', '     we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint. I could tell\\n', \"     you tales of cobbler's wax which would disgust you with human\\n\", \"     nature.' He stepped over to the window and shouted through it at the\\n\", '     top of his voice that the vacancy was filled. A groan of\\n', '     disappointment came up from below, and the folk all trooped away in\\n', '     different directions until there was not a red-head to be seen except\\n', '     my own and that of the manager.\\n', '\\n', '     \"\\'My name,\\' said he, \\'is Mr. Duncan Ross, and I am myself one of the\\n', '     pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor.

To-day is Saturday,\\n', '     and I hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Well, Watson,\" said Holmes when our visitor had left us, \"what do\\n', '     you make of it all?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"I make nothing of it,\" I answered frankly. \"It is a most mysterious\\n', '     business.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"As a rule,\" said Holmes, \"the more bizarre a thing is the less\\n', '     mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless\\n', '     crimes which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the\\n', '     most difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this matter.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"What are you going to do, then?\" I asked.\\n', '\\n', '     \"To smoke,\" he answered. \"It is quite a three pipe problem, and I beg\\n', '     that you won\\'t speak to me for fifty minutes.\" He curled himself up\\n', '     in his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and\\n', '     there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting\\n', '     out like the bill of some strange bird. I had come to the conclusion\\n', '     that he had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he\\n', '     suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has\\n', '     made up his mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.\\n', '\\n', '     \"Sarasate plays at the St. James\\'s Hall this afternoon,\" he remarked.\\n', '     \"What do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare you for a few\\n', '     hours?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"I have nothing to do to-day. My practice is never very absorbing.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Then put on your hat and come. I am going through the City first,\\n', '     and we can have some lunch on the way. I observe that there is a good\\n', '     deal of German music on the programme, which is rather more to my\\n', '     taste than Italian or French. It is introspective, and I want to\\n', '     introspect. Come along!\"\\n', '\\n', '     We travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short\\n', '     walk took us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular story\\n', '     which we had listened to in the morning. It was a poky, little,\\n', '     shabby-genteel place, where four lines of dingy two-storied brick\\n', '     houses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn of\\n', '     weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel-bushes made a hard fight\\n', '     against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls\\n', '     and a brown board with \"Jabez Wilson\" in white letters, upon a corner\\n', '     house, announced the place where our red-headed client carried on his\\n', '     business. Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one\\n', '     side and looked it all over, with his eyes shining brightly between\\n', '     puckered lids. Then he walked slowly up the street, and then down\\n', '     again to the corner, still looking keenly at the houses. Finally he\\n', \"     returned to the pawnbroker's, and, having thumped vigorously upon the\\n\", '     pavement with his stick two or three times, he went up to the door\\n', '     and knocked. It was instantly opened by a bright-looking,\\n', '     clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to step in.\\n', '\\n', '     \"Thank you,\" said Holmes, \"I only wished to ask you how you would go\\n', '     from here to the Strand.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Third right, fourth left,\" answered the assistant promptly, closing\\n', '     the door.\\n', '\\n', '     \"Smart fellow, that,\" observed Holmes as we walked away. \"He is, in\\n', '     my judgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring I am\\n', '     not sure that he has not a claim to be third. I have known something\\n', '     of him before.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Evidently,\" said I, \"Mr. Wilson\\'s assistant counts for a good deal\\n', '     in this mystery of the Red-headed League. I am sure that you inquired\\n', '     your way merely in order that you might see him.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Not him.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"What then?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"The knees of his trousers.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"And what did you see?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"What I expected to see.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Why did you beat the pavement?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. We are\\n', \"     spies in an enemy's country. We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square.\\n\", '     Let us now explore the parts which lie behind it.\"\\n', '\\n', '     The road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner\\n', '     from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to\\n', '     it as the front of a picture does to the back. It was one of the main\\n', '     arteries which conveyed the traffic of the City to the north and\\n', '     west. The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce\\n', '     flowing in a double tide inward and outward, while the footpaths were\\n', '     black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians. It was difficult to\\n', '     realise as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business\\n', '     premises that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded\\n', '     and stagnant square which we had just quitted.\\n', '\\n', '     \"Let me see,\" said Holmes, standing at the corner and glancing along\\n', '     the line, \"I should like just to remember the order of the houses\\n', '     here. It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of London.\\n', \"     There is Mortimer's, the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the\\n\", '     Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian\\n', \"     Restaurant, and McFarlane's carriage-building depot. That carries us\\n\", \"     right on to the other block. And now, Doctor, we've done our work, so\\n\", \"     it's time we had some play. A sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then\\n\", '     off to violin-land, where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony,\\n', '     and there are no red-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums.\"\\n', '\\n', '     My friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a very\\n', '     capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit. All the\\n', '     afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness,\\n', '     gently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the music, while his\\n', '     gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those\\n', '     of Holmes the sleuth-hound, Holmes the relentless, keen-witted,\\n', '     ready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to conceive. In his\\n', '     singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself, and\\n', '     his extreme exactness and astuteness represented, as I have often\\n', '     thought, the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which\\n', '     occasionally predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him\\n', '     from extreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was\\n', '     never so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been\\n', '     lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter\\n', '     editions. Then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come\\n', '     upon him, and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the\\n', '     level of intuition, until those who were unacquainted with his\\n', '     methods would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not\\n', '     that of other mortals. When I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in\\n', \"     the music at St. James's Hall I felt that an evil time might be\\n\", '     coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down.\\n', '\\n', '     \"You want to go home, no doubt, Doctor,\" he remarked as we emerged.\\n', '\\n', '     \"Yes, it would be as well.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"And I have some business to do which will take some hours. This\\n', '     business at Coburg Square is serious.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Why serious?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"A considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason to\\n', '     believe that we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day being\\n', '     Saturday rather complicates matters. I shall want your help\\n', '     to-night.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"At what time?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Ten will be early enough.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"I shall be at Baker Street at ten.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Very well. And, I say, Doctor, there may be some little danger, so\\n', '     kindly put your army revolver in your pocket.\" He waved his hand,\\n', '     turned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the crowd.\\n', '\\n', '     I trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours, but I was always\\n', '     oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with\\n', '     Sherlock Holmes. Here I had heard what he had heard, I had seen what\\n', '     he had seen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw\\n', '     clearly not only what had happened but what was about to happen,\\n', '     while to me the whole business was still confused and grotesque. As I\\n', '     drove home to my house in Kensington I thought over it all, from the\\n', '     extraordinary story of the red-headed copier of the \"Encyclopaedia\"\\n', '     down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg Square, and the ominous words with\\n', '     which he had parted from me. What was this nocturnal expedition, and\\n', '     why should I go armed?  Where were we going, and what were we to do?\\n', \"     I had the hint from Holmes that this smooth-faced pawnbroker's\\n\", '     assistant was a formidable man--a man who might play a deep game. I\\n', '     tried to puzzle it out, but gave it up in despair and set the matter\\n', '     aside until night should bring an explanation.\\n', '\\n', '     It was a quarter-past nine when I started from home and made my way\\n', '     across the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker Street. Two\\n', '     hansoms were standing at the door, and as I entered the passage I\\n', '     heard the sound of voices from above. On entering his room I found\\n', '     Holmes in animated conversation with two men, one of whom I\\n', '     recognised as Peter Jones, the official police agent, while the other\\n', '     was a long, thin, sad-faced man, with a very shiny hat and\\n', '     oppressively respectable frock-coat.\\n', '\\n', '     \"Ha! Our party is complete,\" said Holmes, buttoning up his pea-jacket\\n', '     and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack. \"Watson, I think you\\n', '     know Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me introduce you to Mr.\\n', '     Merryweather, who is to be our companion in to-night\\'s adventure.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"We\\'re hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see,\" said Jones in his\\n', '     consequential way. \"Our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a\\n', '     chase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running\\n', '     down.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase,\"\\n', '     observed Mr. Merryweather gloomily.\\n', '\\n', '     \"You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir,\" said the\\n', '     police agent loftily. \"He has his own little methods, which are, if\\n', \"     he won't mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical and\\n\", '     fantastic, but he has the makings of a detective in him. It is not\\n', '     too much to say that once or twice, as in that business of the Sholto\\n', '     murder and the Agra treasure, he has been more nearly correct than\\n', '     the official force.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right,\" said the stranger\\n', '     with deference. \"Still, I confess that I miss my rubber. It is the\\n', '     first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I have not had\\n', '     my rubber.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"I think you will find,\" said Sherlock Holmes, \"that you will play\\n', '     for a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and that the\\n', '     play will be more exciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather, the stake will\\n', '     be some Â£30,000; and for you, Jones, it will be the man upon whom you\\n', '     wish to lay your hands.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He\\'s a young\\n', '     man, Mr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his profession, and I\\n', '     would rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in London.\\n', \"     He's a remarkable man, is young John Clay. His grandfather was a\\n\", '     royal duke, and he himself has been to Eton and Oxford. His brain is\\n', '     as cunning as his fingers, and though we meet signs of him at every\\n', \"     turn, we never know where to find the man himself. He'll crack a crib\\n\", '     in Scotland one week, and be raising money to build an orphanage in\\n', \"     Cornwall the next. I've been on his track for years and have never\\n\", '     set eyes on him yet.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night.\\n', \"     I've had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay, and I agree\\n\", '     with you that he is at the head of his profession. It is past ten,\\n', '     however, and quite time that we started. If you two will take the\\n', '     first hansom, Watson and I will follow in the second.\"\\n', '\\n', '     Sherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and\\n', '     lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the\\n', '     afternoon. We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets\\n', '     until we emerged into Farrington Street.\\n', '\\n', '     \"We are close there now,\" my friend remarked. \"This fellow\\n', '     Merryweather is a bank director, and personally interested in the\\n', '     matter. I thought it as well to have Jones with us also. He is not a\\n', '     bad fellow, though an absolute imbecile in his profession. He has one\\n', '     positive virtue. He is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a\\n', '     lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone. Here we are, and they are\\n', '     waiting for us.\"\\n', '\\n', '     We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found\\n', '     ourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and, following the\\n', '     guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage and\\n', '     through a side door, which he opened for us. Within there was a small\\n', '     corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. This also was\\n', '     opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which\\n', '     terminated at another formidable gate. Mr. Merryweather stopped to\\n', '     light a lantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling\\n', '     passage, and so, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or\\n', '     cellar, which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes.\\n', '\\n', '     \"You are not very vulnerable from above,\" Holmes remarked as he held\\n', '     up the lantern and gazed about him.\\n', '\\n', '     \"Nor from below,\" said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon the\\n', '     flags which lined the floor. \"Why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!\"\\n', '     he remarked, looking up in surprise.\\n', '\\n', '     \"I must really ask you to be a little more quiet!\" said Holmes\\n', '     severely. \"You have already imperilled the whole success of our\\n', '     expedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down\\n', '     upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?\"\\n', '\\n', '     The solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very\\n', '     injured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his knees\\n', '     upon the floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to\\n', '     examine minutely the cracks between the stones. A few seconds\\n', '     sufficed to satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again and put his\\n', '     glass in his pocket.\\n', '\\n', '     \"We have at least an hour before us,\" he remarked, \"for they can\\n', '     hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed.\\n', '     Then they will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work\\n', '     the longer time they will have for their escape. We are at present,\\n', '     Doctor--as no doubt you have divined--in the cellar of the City\\n', '     branch of one of the principal London banks. Mr. Merryweather is the\\n', '     chairman of directors, and he will explain to you that there are\\n', '     reasons why the more daring criminals of London should take a\\n', '     considerable interest in this cellar at present.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"It is our French gold,\" whispered the director. \"We have had several\\n', '     warnings that an attempt might be made upon it.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Your French gold?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and\\n', '     borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France.\\n', '     It has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the\\n', '     money, and that it is still lying in our cellar. The crate upon which\\n', '     I sit contains 2,000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil.\\n', '     Our reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept\\n', '     in a single branch office, and the directors have had misgivings upon\\n', '     the subject.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Which were very well justified,\" observed Holmes. \"And now it is\\n', '     time that we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an hour\\n', '     matters will come to a head. In the meantime Mr. Merryweather, we\\n', '     must put the screen over that dark lantern.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"And sit in the dark?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and I\\n', '     thought that, as we were a partie carrÃ©e, you might have your rubber\\n', \"     after all. But I see that the enemy's preparations have gone so far\\n\", '     that we cannot risk the presence of a light. And, first of all, we\\n', '     must choose our positions. These are daring men, and though we shall\\n', '     take them at a disadvantage, they may do us some harm unless we are\\n', '     careful. I shall stand behind this crate, and do you conceal\\n', '     yourselves behind those. Then, when I flash a light upon them, close\\n', '     in swiftly. If they fire, Watson, have no compunction about shooting\\n', '     them down.\"\\n', '\\n', '     I placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind\\n', '     which I crouched. Holmes shot the slide across the front of his\\n', '     lantern and left us in pitch darkness--such an absolute darkness as I\\n', '     have never before experienced. The smell of hot metal remained to\\n', '     assure us that the light was still there, ready to flash out at a\\n', \"     moment's notice. To me, with my nerves worked up to a pitch of\\n\", '     expectancy, there was something depressing and subduing in the sudden\\n', '     gloom, and in the cold dank air of the vault.\\n', '\\n', '     \"They have but one retreat,\" whispered Holmes. \"That is back through\\n', '     the house into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope that you have done what I\\n', '     asked you, Jones?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Then we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be silent and\\n', '     wait.\"\\n', '\\n', '     What a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards it was but an\\n', '     hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must have\\n', '     almost gone and the dawn be breaking above us. My limbs were weary\\n', '     and stiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my nerves were\\n', '     worked up to the highest pitch of tension, and my hearing was so\\n', '     acute that I could not only hear the gentle breathing of my\\n', '     companions, but I could distinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of\\n', '     the bulky Jones from the thin, sighing note of the bank director.\\n', '     From my position I could look over the case in the direction of the\\n', '     floor. Suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light.\\n', '\\n', '     At first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then it\\n', '     lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then, without any\\n', '     warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared, a white,\\n', '     almost womanly hand, which felt about in the centre of the little\\n', '     area of light. For a minute or more the hand, with its writhing\\n', '     fingers, protruded out of the floor. Then it was withdrawn as\\n', '     suddenly as it appeared, and all was dark again save the single lurid\\n', '     spark which marked a chink between the stones.\\n', '\\n', '     Its disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending,\\n', '     tearing sound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its\\n', '     side and left a square, gaping hole, through which streamed the light\\n', '     of a lantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face,\\n', '     which looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either side of\\n', '     the aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high, until one\\n', '     knee rested upon the edge. In another instant he stood at the side of\\n', '     the hole and was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like\\n', '     himself, with a pale face and a shock of very red hair.\\n', '\\n', '     \"It\\'s all clear,\" he whispered. \"Have you the chisel and the bags?\\n', '     Great Scott! Jump, Archie, jump, and I\\'ll swing for it!\"\\n', '\\n', '     Sherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar.\\n', '     The other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of rending cloth\\n', '     as Jones clutched at his skirts. The light flashed upon the barrel of\\n', \"     a revolver, but Holmes' hunting crop came down on the man's wrist,\\n\", '     and the pistol clinked upon the stone floor.\\n', '\\n', '     \"It\\'s no use, John Clay,\" said Holmes blandly. \"You have no chance at\\n', '     all.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"So I see,\" the other answered with the utmost coolness. \"I fancy\\n', '     that my pal is all right, though I see you have got his coat-tails.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"There are three men waiting for him at the door,\" said Holmes.\\n', '\\n', '     \"Oh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely. I must\\n', '     compliment you.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"And I you,\" Holmes answered. \"Your red-headed idea was very new and\\n', '     effective.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"You\\'ll see your pal again presently,\" said Jones. \"He\\'s quicker at\\n', '     climbing down holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix the\\n', '     derbies.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,\" remarked\\n', '     our prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists. \"You may not\\n', '     be aware that I have royal blood in my veins. Have the goodness,\\n', '     also, when you address me always to say \\'sir\\' and \\'please.\\'\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"All right,\" said Jones with a stare and a snigger. \"Well, would you\\n', '     please, sir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab to carry your\\n', '     Highness to the police-station?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"That is better,\" said John Clay serenely. He made a sweeping bow to\\n', '     the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the\\n', '     detective.\\n', '\\n', '     \"Really, Mr. Holmes,\" said Mr. Merryweather as we followed them from\\n', '     the cellar, \"I do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you.\\n', '     There is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most\\n', '     complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery\\n', '     that have ever come within my experience.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr.\\n', '     John Clay,\" said Holmes. \"I have been at some small expense over this\\n', '     matter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that I am\\n', '     amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways\\n', '     unique, and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the\\n', '     Red-headed League.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"You see, Watson,\" he explained in the early hours of the morning as\\n', '     we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street, \"it was\\n', '     perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of\\n', '     this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the League,\\n', \"     and the copying of the 'Encyclopaedia,' must be to get this not\\n\", '     over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every\\n', '     day. It was a curious way of managing it, but, really, it would be\\n', '     difficult to suggest a better. The method was no doubt suggested to\\n', \"     Clay's ingenious mind by the colour of his accomplice's hair. The Â£4\\n\", '     a week was a lure which must draw him, and what was it to them, who\\n', '     were playing for thousands? They put in the advertisement, one rogue\\n', '     has the temporary office, the other rogue incites the man to apply\\n', '     for it, and together they manage to secure his absence every morning\\n', '     in the week. From the time that I heard of the assistant having come\\n', '     for half wages, it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive\\n', '     for securing the situation.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"But how could you guess what the motive was?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Had there been women in the house, I should have suspected a mere\\n', \"     vulgar intrigue. That, however, was out of the question. The man's\\n\", '     business was a small one, and there was nothing in his house which\\n', '     could account for such elaborate preparations, and such an\\n', '     expenditure as they were at. It must, then, be something out of the\\n', \"     house. What could it be? I thought of the assistant's fondness for\\n\", '     photography, and his trick of vanishing into the cellar. The cellar!\\n', '     There was the end of this tangled clue. Then I made inquiries as to\\n', '     this mysterious assistant and found that I had to deal with one of\\n', '     the coolest and most daring criminals in London. He was doing\\n', '     something in the cellar--something which took many hours a day for\\n', '     months on end. What could it be, once more? I could think of nothing\\n', '     save that he was running a tunnel to some other building.\\n', '\\n', '     \"So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I\\n', '     surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. I was\\n', '     ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind. It\\n', '     was not in front. Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the\\n', '     assistant answered it. We have had some skirmishes, but we had never\\n', '     set eyes upon each other before. I hardly looked at his face. His\\n', '     knees were what I wished to see. You must yourself have remarked how\\n', '     worn, wrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of those hours of\\n', '     burrowing. The only remaining point was what they were burrowing for.\\n', '     I walked round the corner, saw the City and Suburban Bank abutted on\\n', \"     our friend's premises, and felt that I had solved my problem. When\\n\", '     you drove home after the concert I called upon Scotland Yard and upon\\n', '     the chairman of the bank directors, with the result that you have\\n', '     seen.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"And how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night?\"\\n', '     I asked.\\n', '\\n', '     \"Well, when they closed their League offices that was a sign that\\n', \"     they cared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson's presence--in other\\n\", '     words, that they had completed their tunnel. But it was essential\\n', '     that they should use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the\\n', '     bullion might be removed. Saturday would suit them better than any\\n', '     other day, as it would give them two days for their escape. For all\\n', '     these reasons I expected them to come to-night.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"You reasoned it out beautifully,\" I exclaimed in unfeigned\\n', '     admiration. \"It is so long a chain, and yet every link rings true.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"It saved me from ennui,\" he answered, yawning. \"Alas! I already feel\\n', '     it closing in upon me. My life is spent in one long effort to escape\\n', '     from the commonplaces of existence. These little problems help me to\\n', '     do so.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"And you are a benefactor of the race,\" said I.\\n', '\\n', '     He shrugged his shoulders. \"Well, perhaps, after all, it is of some\\n', '     little use,\" he remarked. \"\\'L\\'homme c\\'est rien--l\\'oeuvre c\\'est tout,\\'\\n', '     as Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sand.\"\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '                               A CASE OF IDENTITY\\n', '\\n', '     \"My dear fellow,\" said Sherlock Holmes as we sat on either side of\\n', '     the fire in his lodgings at Baker Street, \"life is infinitely\\n', '     stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent. We would\\n', '     not dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of\\n', '     existence. If we could fly out of that window hand in hand, hover\\n', '     over this great city, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at the\\n', '     queer things which are going on, the strange coincidences, the\\n', '     plannings, the cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events,\\n', '     working through generations, and leading to the most outrÃ© results,\\n', '     it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen\\n', '     conclusions most stale and unprofitable.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"And yet I am not convinced of it,\" I answered. \"The cases which come\\n', '     to light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and vulgar\\n', '     enough. We have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme\\n', '     limits, and yet the result is, it must be confessed, neither\\n', '     fascinating nor artistic.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a\\n', '     realistic effect,\" remarked Holmes. \"This is wanting in the police\\n', '     report, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of\\n', '     the magistrate than upon the details, which to an observer contain\\n', '     the vital essence of the whole matter. Depend upon it, there is\\n', '     nothing so unnatural as the commonplace.\"\\n', '\\n', '     I smiled and shook my head. \"I can quite understand your thinking\\n', '     so.\" I said. \"Of course, in your position of unofficial adviser and\\n', '     helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout three\\n', '     continents, you are brought in contact with all that is strange and\\n', '     bizarre. But here\"--I picked up the morning paper from the\\n', '     ground--\"let us put it to a practical test. Here is the first heading\\n', \"     upon which I come. 'A husband's cruelty to his wife.' There is half a\\n\", '     column of print, but I know without reading it that it is all\\n', '     perfectly familiar to me. There is, of course, the other woman, the\\n', '     drink, the push, the blow, the bruise, the sympathetic sister or\\n', '     landlady. The crudest of writers could invent nothing more crude.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument,\" said\\n', '     Holmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it. \"This is the\\n', '     Dundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged in clearing\\n', '     up some small points in connection with it. The husband was a\\n', '     teetotaler, there was no other woman, and the conduct complained of\\n', '     was that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by\\n', '     taking out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife, which, you\\n', '     will allow, is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of\\n', '     the average story-teller. Take a pinch of snuff, Doctor, and\\n', '     acknowledge that I have scored over you in your example.\"\\n', '\\n', '     He held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in the\\n', '     centre of the lid. Its splendour was in such contrast to his homely\\n', '     ways and simple life that I could not help commenting upon it.\\n', '\\n', '     \"Ah,\" said he, \"I forgot that I had not seen you for some weeks. It\\n', '     is a little souvenir from the King of Bohemia in return for my\\n', '     assistance in the case of the Irene Adler papers.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"And the ring?\" I asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant which\\n', '     sparkled upon his finger.\\n', '\\n', '     \"It was from the reigning family of Holland, though the matter in\\n', '     which I served them was of such delicacy that I cannot confide it\\n', '     even to you, who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of my\\n', '     little problems.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"And have you any on hand just now?\" I asked with interest.\\n', '\\n', '     \"Some ten or twelve, but none which present any feature of interest.\\n', '     They are important, you understand, without being interesting.\\n', '     Indeed, I have found that it is usually in unimportant matters that\\n', '     there is a field for the observation, and for the quick analysis of\\n', '     cause and effect which gives the charm to an investigation. The\\n', '     larger crimes are apt to be the simpler, for the bigger the crime the\\n', '     more obvious, as a rule, is the motive. In these cases, save for one\\n', '     rather intricate matter which has been referred to me from\\n', '     Marseilles, there is nothing which presents any features of interest.\\n', '     It is possible, however, that I may have something better before very\\n', '     many minutes are over, for this is one of my clients, or I am much\\n', '     mistaken.\"\\n', '\\n', '     He had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted\\n', '     blinds gazing down into the dull neutral-tinted London street.\\n', '     Looking over his shoulder, I saw that on the pavement opposite there\\n', '     stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck, and a large\\n', '     curling red feather in a broad-brimmed hat which was tilted in a\\n', '     coquettish Duchess of Devonshire fashion over her ear. From under\\n', '     this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous, hesitating fashion at\\n', '     our windows, while her body oscillated backward and forward, and her\\n', '     fingers fidgeted with her glove buttons. Suddenly, with a plunge, as\\n', '     of the swimmer who leaves the bank, she hurried across the road, and\\n', '     we heard the sharp clang of the bell.\\n', '\\n', '     \"I have seen those symptoms before,\" said Holmes, throwing his\\n', '     cigarette into the fire. \"Oscillation upon the pavement always means\\n', '     an affaire de coeur. She would like advice, but is not sure that the\\n', '     matter is not too delicate for communication. And yet even here we\\n', '     may discriminate. When a woman has been seriously wronged by a man\\n', '     she no longer oscillates, and the usual symptom is a broken bell\\n', '     wire. Here we may take it that there is a love matter, but that the\\n', '     maiden is not so much angry as perplexed, or grieved. But here she\\n', '     comes in person to resolve our doubts.\"\\n', '\\n', '     As he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons\\n', '     entered to announce Miss Mary Sutherland, while the lady herself\\n', '     loomed behind his small black figure like a full-sailed merchant-man\\n', '     behind a tiny pilot boat. Sherlock Holmes welcomed her with the easy\\n', '     courtesy for which he was remarkable, and, having closed the door and\\n', '     bowed her into an armchair, he looked her over in the minute and yet\\n', '     abstracted fashion which was peculiar to him.\\n', '\\n', '     \"Do you not find,\" he said, \"that with your short sight it is a\\n', '     little trying to do so much typewriting?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"I did at first,\" she answered, \"but now I know where the letters are\\n', '     without looking.\" Then, suddenly realising the full purport of his\\n', '     words, she gave a violent start and looked up, with fear and\\n', '     astonishment upon her broad, good-humoured face. \"You\\'ve heard about\\n', '     me, Mr. Holmes,\" she cried, \"else how could you know all that?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Never mind,\" said Holmes, laughing; \"it is my business to know\\n', '     things. Perhaps I have trained myself to see what others overlook. If\\n', '     not, why should you come to consult me?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"I came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs. Etherege, whose\\n', '     husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had given him\\n', \"     up for dead. Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish you would do as much for me. I'm\\n\", '     not rich, but still I have a hundred a year in my own right, besides\\n', '     the little that I make by the machine, and I would give it all to\\n', '     know what has become of Mr. Hosmer Angel.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?\" asked Sherlock\\n', '     Holmes, with his finger-tips together and his eyes to the ceiling.\\n', '\\n', '     Again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss\\n', '     Mary Sutherland. \"Yes, I did bang out of the house,\" she said, \"for\\n', '     it made me angry to see the easy way in which Mr. Windibank--that is,\\n', '     my father--took it all. He would not go to the police, and he would\\n', '     not go to you, and so at last, as he would do nothing and kept on\\n', '     saying that there was no harm done, it made me mad, and I just on\\n', '     with my things and came right away to you.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Your father,\" said Holmes, \"your stepfather, surely, since the name\\n', '     is different.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Yes, my stepfather. I call him father, though it sounds funny, too,\\n', '     for he is only five years and two months older than myself.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"And your mother is alive?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Oh, yes, mother is alive and well. I wasn\\'t best pleased, Mr.\\n', \"     Holmes, when she married again so soon after father's death, and a\\n\", '     man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself. Father was a\\n', '     plumber in the Tottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy business\\n', '     behind him, which mother carried on with Mr. Hardy, the foreman; but\\n', '     when Mr. Windibank came he made her sell the business, for he was\\n', '     very superior, being a traveller in wines. They got Â£4700 for the\\n', \"     goodwill and interest, which wasn't near as much as father could have\\n\", '     got if he had been alive.\"\\n', '\\n', '     I had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this rambling\\n', '     and inconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he had listened\\n', '     with the greatest concentration of attention.\\n', '\\n', '     \"Your own little income,\" he asked, \"does it come out of the\\n', '     business?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Oh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle Ned in\\n', '     Auckland. It is in New Zealand stock, paying 4Â½ per cent. Two\\n', '     thousand five hundred pounds was the amount, but I can only touch the\\n', '     interest.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"You interest me extremely,\" said Holmes. \"And since you draw so\\n', '     large a sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the bargain,\\n', '     you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way. I\\n', '     believe that a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of\\n', '     about Â£60.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"I could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you understand\\n', \"     that as long as I live at home I don't wish to be a burden to them,\\n\", '     and so they have the use of the money just while I am staying with\\n', '     them. Of course, that is only just for the time. Mr. Windibank draws\\n', '     my interest every quarter and pays it over to mother, and I find that\\n', '     I can do pretty well with what I earn at typewriting. It brings me\\n', '     twopence a sheet, and I can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in\\n', '     a day.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"You have made your position very clear to me,\" said Holmes. \"This is\\n', '     my friend, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before\\n', '     myself. Kindly tell us now all about your connection with Mr. Hosmer\\n', '     Angel.\"\\n', '\\n', \"     A flush stole over Miss Sutherland's face, and she picked nervously\\n\", '     at the fringe of her jacket. \"I met him first at the gasfitters\\'\\n', '     ball,\" she said. \"They used to send father tickets when he was alive,\\n', '     and then afterwards they remembered us, and sent them to mother. Mr.\\n', '     Windibank did not wish us to go. He never did wish us to go anywhere.\\n', '     He would get quite mad if I wanted so much as to join a Sunday-school\\n', '     treat. But this time I was set on going, and I would go; for what\\n', '     right had he to prevent? He said the folk were not fit for us to\\n', \"     know, when all father's friends were to be there. And he said that I\\n\", '     had nothing fit to wear, when I had my purple plush that I had never\\n', '     so much as taken out of the drawer. At last, when nothing else would\\n', '     do, he went off to France upon the business of the firm, but we went,\\n', '     mother and I, with Mr. Hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it was\\n', '     there I met Mr. Hosmer Angel.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"I suppose,\" said Holmes, \"that when Mr. Windibank came back from\\n', '     France he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Oh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember, and\\n', '     shrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying anything to\\n', '     a woman, for she would have her way.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"I see. Then at the gasfitters\\' ball you met, as I understand, a\\n', '     gentleman called Mr. Hosmer Angel.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Yes, sir. I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if we\\n', '     had got home all safe, and after that we met him--that is to say, Mr.\\n', '     Holmes, I met him twice for walks, but after that father came back\\n', '     again, and Mr. Hosmer Angel could not come to the house any more.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"No?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Well, you know father didn\\'t like anything of the sort. He wouldn\\'t\\n', '     have any visitors if he could help it, and he used to say that a\\n', '     woman should be happy in her own family circle. But then, as I used\\n', '     to say to mother, a woman wants her own circle to begin with, and I\\n', '     had not got mine yet.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"But how about Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he make no attempt to see you?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Well, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer\\n', '     wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each\\n', '     other until he had gone. We could write in the meantime, and he used\\n', '     to write every day. I took the letters in in the morning, so there\\n', '     was no need for father to know.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Oh, yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after the first walk that we\\n', '     took. Hosmer--Mr. Angel--was a cashier in an office in Leadenhall\\n', '     Street--and--\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"What office?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"That\\'s the worst of it, Mr. Holmes, I don\\'t know.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Where did he live, then?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"He slept on the premises.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"And you don\\'t know his address?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"No--except that it was Leadenhall Street.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Where did you address your letters, then?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"To the Leadenhall Street Post Office, to be left till called for. He\\n', '     said that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all\\n', '     the other clerks about having letters from a lady, so I offered to\\n', \"     typewrite them, like he did his, but he wouldn't have that, for he\\n\", '     said that when I wrote them they seemed to come from me, but when\\n', '     they were typewritten he always felt that the machine had come\\n', '     between us. That will just show you how fond he was of me, Mr.\\n', '     Holmes, and the little things that he would think of.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"It was most suggestive,\" said Holmes. \"It has long been an axiom of\\n', '     mine that the little things are infinitely the most important.  Can\\n', '     you remember any other little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"He was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He would rather walk with me in\\n', '     the evening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to be\\n', '     conspicuous. Very retiring and gentlemanly he was. Even his voice was\\n', \"     gentle. He'd had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young, he\\n\", '     told me, and it had left him with a weak throat, and a hesitating,\\n', '     whispering fashion of speech. He was always well dressed, very neat\\n', '     and plain, but his eyes were weak, just as mine are, and he wore\\n', '     tinted glasses against the glare.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Well, and what happened when Mr. Windibank, your stepfather,\\n', '     returned to France?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Mr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again and proposed that we should\\n', '     marry before father came back. He was in dreadful earnest and made me\\n', '     swear, with my hands on the Testament, that whatever happened I would\\n', '     always be true to him. Mother said he was quite right to make me\\n', '     swear, and that it was a sign of his passion. Mother was all in his\\n', '     favour from the first and was even fonder of him than I was. Then,\\n', '     when they talked of marrying within the week, I began to ask about\\n', '     father; but they both said never to mind about father, but just to\\n', '     tell him afterwards, and mother said she would make it all right with\\n', \"     him. I didn't quite like that, Mr. Holmes. It seemed funny that I\\n\", '     should ask his leave, as he was only a few years older than me; but I\\n', \"     didn't want to do anything on the sly, so I wrote to father at\\n\", '     Bordeaux, where the company has its French offices, but the letter\\n', '     came back to me on the very morning of the wedding.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"It missed him, then?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Yes, sir; for he had started to England just before it arrived.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Ha! that was unfortunate. Your wedding was arranged, then, for the\\n', '     Friday. Was it to be in church?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Yes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviour\\'s, near\\n', \"     King's Cross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St.\\n\", '     Pancras Hotel. Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were two\\n', '     of us he put us both into it and stepped himself into a four-wheeler,\\n', '     which happened to be the only other cab in the street. We got to the\\n', '     church first, and when the four-wheeler drove up we waited for him to\\n', '     step out, but he never did, and when the cabman got down from the box\\n', '     and looked there was no one there! The cabman said that he could not\\n', '     imagine what had become of him, for he had seen him get in with his\\n', '     own eyes. That was last Friday, Mr. Holmes, and I have never seen or\\n', '     heard anything since then to throw any light upon what became of\\n', '     him.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"It seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated,\" said\\n', '     Holmes.\\n', '\\n', '     \"Oh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so. Why, all the\\n', '     morning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to be\\n', '     true; and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to\\n', '     separate us, I was always to remember that I was pledged to him, and\\n', '     that he would claim his pledge sooner or later. It seemed strange\\n', '     talk for a wedding-morning, but what has happened since gives a\\n', '     meaning to it.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Most certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then, that some\\n', '     unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Yes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he would\\n', '     not have talked so. And then I think that what he foresaw happened.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"But you have no notion as to what it could have been?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"None.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"One more question. How did your mother take the matter?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"She was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the matter\\n', '     again.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"And your father? Did you tell him?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Yes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had happened,\\n', '     and that I should hear of Hosmer again. As he said, what interest\\n', '     could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of the church, and then\\n', '     leaving me? Now, if he had borrowed my money, or if he had married me\\n', '     and got my money settled on him, there might be some reason, but\\n', '     Hosmer was very independent about money and never would look at a\\n', '     shilling of mine. And yet, what could have happened? And why could he\\n', \"     not write? Oh, it drives me half-mad to think of it, and I can't\\n\", '     sleep a wink at night.\" She pulled a little handkerchief out of her\\n', '     muff and began to sob heavily into it.\\n', '\\n', '     \"I shall glance into the case for you,\" said Holmes, rising, \"and I\\n', '     have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result. Let the\\n', '     weight of the matter rest upon me now, and do not let your mind dwell\\n', '     upon it further. Above all, try to let Mr. Hosmer Angel vanish from\\n', '     your memory, as he has done from your life.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Then you don\\'t think I\\'ll see him again?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"I fear not.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Then what has happened to him?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"You will leave that question in my hands.

I shall be true\\n', '     to Hosmer. He shall find me ready when he comes back.\"\\n', '\\n', '     For all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face, there was\\n', '     something noble in the simple faith of our visitor which compelled\\n', '     our respect. She laid her little bundle of papers upon the table and\\n', '     went her way, with a promise to come again whenever she might be\\n', '     summoned.\\n', '\\n', '     Sherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips\\n', '     still pressed together, his legs stretched out in front of him, and\\n', '     his gaze directed upward to the ceiling. Then he took down from the\\n', '     rack the old and oily clay pipe, which was to him as a counsellor,\\n', '     and, having lit it, he leaned back in his chair, with the thick blue\\n', '     cloud-wreaths spinning up from him, and a look of infinite languor in\\n', '     his face.\\n', '\\n', '     \"Quite an interesting study, that maiden,\" he observed. \"I found her\\n', '     more interesting than her little problem, which, by the way, is\\n', '     rather a trite one. You will find parallel cases, if you consult my\\n', \"     index, in Andover in '77, and there was something of the sort at The\\n\", '     Hague last year. Old as is the idea, however, there were one or two\\n', '     details which were new to me. But the maiden herself was most\\n', '     instructive.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"You appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible\\n', '     to me,\" I remarked.\\n', '\\n', '     \"Not invisible but unnoticed, Watson. You did not know where to look,\\n', '     and so you missed all that was important. I can never bring you to\\n', '     realise the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of thumb-nails,\\n', '     or the great issues that may hang from a boot-lace. Now, what did you\\n', '     gather from that woman\\'s appearance? Describe it.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Well, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a\\n', '     feather of a brickish red. Her jacket was black, with black beads\\n', '     sewn upon it, and a fringe of little black jet ornaments. Her dress\\n', '     was brown, rather darker than coffee colour, with a little purple\\n', '     plush at the neck and sleeves. Her gloves were greyish and were worn\\n', \"     through at the right forefinger. Her boots I didn't observe. She had\\n\", '     small round, hanging gold earrings, and a general air of being fairly\\n', '     well-to-do in a vulgar, comfortable, easy-going way.\"\\n', '\\n', '     Sherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.\\n', '\\n', '     \"\\'Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully. You have\\n', '     really done very well indeed. It is true that you have missed\\n', '     everything of importance, but you have hit upon the method, and you\\n', '     have a quick eye for colour. Never trust to general impressions, my\\n', '     boy, but concentrate yourself upon details. My first glance is always\\n', \"     at a woman's sleeve. In a man it is perhaps better first to take the\\n\", '     knee of the trouser. As you observe, this woman had plush upon her\\n', '     sleeves, which is a most useful material for showing traces. The\\n', '     double line a little above the wrist, where the typewritist presses\\n', '     against the table, was beautifully defined. The sewing-machine, of\\n', '     the hand type, leaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and\\n', '     on the side of it farthest from the thumb, instead of being right\\n', '     across the broadest part, as this was. I then glanced at her face,\\n', '     and, observing the dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I\\n', '     ventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting, which seemed to\\n', '     surprise her.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"It surprised me.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"But, surely, it was obvious. I was then much surprised and\\n', '     interested on glancing down to observe that, though the boots which\\n', '     she was wearing were not unlike each other, they were really odd\\n', '     ones; the one having a slightly decorated toe-cap, and the other a\\n', '     plain one. One was buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of\\n', '     five, and the other at the first, third, and fifth. Now, when you see\\n', '     that a young lady, otherwise neatly dressed, has come away from home\\n', '     with odd boots, half-buttoned, it is no great deduction to say that\\n', '     she came away in a hurry.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"And what else?\" I asked, keenly interested, as I always was, by my\\n', \"     friend's incisive reasoning.\\n\", '\\n', '     \"I noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving home\\n', '     but after being fully dressed. You observed that her right glove was\\n', '     torn at the forefinger, but you did not apparently see that both\\n', '     glove and finger were stained with violet ink. She had written in a\\n', '     hurry and dipped her pen too deep. It must have been this morning, or\\n', '     the mark would not remain clear upon the finger. All this is amusing,\\n', '     though rather elementary, but I must go back to business, Watson.\\n', '     Would you mind reading me the advertised description of Mr. Hosmer\\n', '     Angel?\"\\n', '\\n', '     I held the little printed slip to the light.\\n', '\\n', '     \"Missing,\" it said, \"on the morning of the fourteenth, a gentleman\\n', '     named Hosmer Angel. About five ft. seven in. in height; strongly\\n', '     built, sallow complexion, black hair, a little bald in the centre,\\n', '     bushy, black side-whiskers and moustache; tinted glasses, slight\\n', '     infirmity of speech. Was dressed, when last seen, in black frock-coat\\n', '     faced with silk, black waistcoat, gold Albert chain, and grey Harris\\n', '     tweed trousers, with brown gaiters over elastic-sided boots. Known to\\n', '     have been employed in an office in Leadenhall Street. Anybody\\n', '     bringing--\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"That will do,\" said Holmes. \"As to the letters,\" he continued,\\n', '     glancing over them, \"they are very commonplace. Absolutely no clue in\\n', '     them to Mr. Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once. There is one\\n', '     remarkable point, however, which will no doubt strike you.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"They are typewritten,\" I remarked.\\n', '\\n', '     \"Not only that, but the signature is typewritten. Look at the neat\\n', \"     little 'Hosmer Angel' at the bottom. There is a date, you see, but no\\n\", '     superscription except Leadenhall Street, which is rather vague. The\\n', '     point about the signature is very suggestive--in fact, we may call it\\n', '     conclusive.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Of what?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"My dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears\\n', '     upon the case?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"I cannot say that I do unless it were that he wished to be able to\\n', '     deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were\\n', '     instituted.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"No, that was not the point. However, I shall write two letters,\\n', '     which should settle the matter. One is to a firm in the City, the\\n', \"     other is to the young lady's stepfather, Mr. Windibank, asking him\\n\", \"     whether he could meet us here at six o'clock tomorrow evening. It is\\n\", '     just as well that we should do business with the male relatives. And\\n', '     now, Doctor, we can do nothing until the answers to those letters\\n', '     come, so we may put our little problem upon the shelf for the\\n', '     interim.\"\\n', '\\n', \"     I had had so many reasons to believe in my friend's subtle powers of\\n\", '     reasoning and extraordinary energy in action that I felt that he must\\n', '     have some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour with which\\n', '     he treated the singular mystery which he had been called upon to\\n', '     fathom. Once only had I known him to fail, in the case of the King of\\n', '     Bohemia and of the Irene Adler photograph; but when I looked back to\\n', '     the weird business of the Sign of Four, and the extraordinary\\n', '     circumstances connected with the Study in Scarlet, I felt that it\\n', '     would be a strange tangle indeed which he could not unravel.\\n', '\\n', '     I left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the\\n', '     conviction that when I came again on the next evening I would find\\n', '     that he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up to the\\n', '     identity of the disappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary Sutherland.\\n', '\\n', '     A professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at\\n', '     the time, and the whole of next day I was busy at the bedside of the\\n', \"     sufferer. It was not until close upon six o'clock that I found myself\\n\", '     free and was able to spring into a hansom and drive to Baker Street,\\n', '     half afraid that I might be too late to assist at the dÃ©nouement of\\n', '     the little mystery. I found Sherlock Holmes alone, however, half\\n', '     asleep, with his long, thin form curled up in the recesses of his\\n', '     armchair. A formidable array of bottles and test-tubes, with the\\n', '     pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid, told me that he had spent\\n', '     his day in the chemical work which was so dear to him.\\n', '\\n', '     \"Well, have you solved it?\" I asked as I entered.\\n', '\\n', '     \"Yes. It was the bisulphate of baryta.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"No, no, the mystery!\" I cried.\\n', '\\n', '     \"Oh, that! I thought of the salt that I have been working upon. There\\n', '     was never any mystery in the matter, though, as I said yesterday,\\n', '     some of the details are of interest. The only drawback is that there\\n', '     is no law, I fear, that can touch the scoundrel.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Who was he, then, and what was his object in deserting Miss\\n', '     Sutherland?\"\\n', '\\n', '     The question was hardly out of my mouth, and Holmes had not yet\\n', '     opened his lips to reply, when we heard a heavy footfall in the\\n', '     passage and a tap at the door.\\n', '\\n', '     \"This is the girl\\'s stepfather, Mr. James Windibank,\" said Holmes.\\n', '     \"He has written to me to say that he would be here at six. Come in!\"\\n', '\\n', '     The man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some thirty\\n', '     years of age, clean-shaven, and sallow-skinned, with a bland,\\n', '     insinuating manner, and a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating\\n', '     grey eyes. He shot a questioning glance at each of us, placed his\\n', '     shiny top-hat upon the sideboard, and with a slight bow sidled down\\n', '     into the nearest chair.\\n', '\\n', '     \"Good-evening, Mr. James Windibank,\" said Holmes. \"I think that this\\n', '     typewritten letter is from you, in which you made an appointment with\\n', '     me for six o\\'clock?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Yes, sir. I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not quite my\\n', '     own master, you know. I am sorry that Miss Sutherland has troubled\\n', '     you about this little matter, for I think it is far better not to\\n', '     wash linen of the sort in public. It was quite against my wishes that\\n', '     she came, but she is a very excitable, impulsive girl, as you may\\n', '     have noticed, and she is not easily controlled when she has made up\\n', '     her mind on a point. Of course, I did not mind you so much, as you\\n', '     are not connected with the official police, but it is not pleasant to\\n', '     have a family misfortune like this noised abroad. Besides, it is a\\n', '     useless expense, for how could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"On the contrary,\" said Holmes quietly; \"I have every reason to\\n', '     believe that I will succeed in discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel.\"\\n', '\\n', '     Mr. Windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves. \"I am\\n', '     delighted to hear it,\" he said.\\n', '\\n', '     \"It is a curious thing,\" remarked Holmes, \"that a typewriter has\\n', \"     really quite as much individuality as a man's handwriting. Unless\\n\", '     they are quite new, no two of them write exactly alike. Some letters\\n', '     get more worn than others, and some wear only on one side. Now, you\\n', '     remark in this note of yours, Mr. Windibank, that in every case there\\n', \"     is some little slurring over of the 'e,' and a slight defect in the\\n\", \"     tail of the 'r.' There are fourteen other characteristics, but those\\n\", '     are the more obvious.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"We do all our correspondence with this machine at the office, and no\\n', '     doubt it is a little worn,\" our visitor answered, glancing keenly at\\n', '     Holmes with his bright little eyes.\\n', '\\n', '     \"And now I will show you what is really a very interesting study, Mr.\\n', '     Windibank,\" Holmes continued. \"I think of writing another little\\n', '     monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation to\\n', '     crime. It is a subject to which I have devoted some little attention.\\n', '     I have here four letters which purport to come from the missing man.\\n', \"     They are all typewritten. In each case, not only are the 'e's'\\n\", \"     slurred and the 'r's' tailless, but you will observe, if you care to\\n\", '     use my magnifying lens, that the fourteen other characteristics to\\n', '     which I have alluded are there as well.\"\\n', '\\n', '     Mr. Windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat. \"I\\n', '     cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes,\" he\\n', '     said. \"If you can catch the man, catch him, and let me know when you\\n', '     have done it.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Certainly,\" said Holmes, stepping over and turning the key in the\\n', '     door. \"I let you know, then, that I have caught him!\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"What! where?\" shouted Mr. Windibank, turning white to his lips and\\n', '     glancing about him like a rat in a trap.\\n', '\\n', '     \"Oh, it won\\'t do--really it won\\'t,\" said Holmes suavely. \"There is no\\n', '     possible getting out of it, Mr. Windibank. It is quite too\\n', '     transparent, and it was a very bad compliment when you said that it\\n', \"     was impossible for me to solve so simple a question. That's right!\\n\", '     Sit down and let us talk it over.\"\\n', '\\n', '     Our visitor collapsed into a chair, with a ghastly face and a glitter\\n', '     of moisture on his brow. \"It--it\\'s not actionable,\" he stammered.\\n', '\\n', '     \"I am very much afraid that it is not. But between ourselves,\\n', '     Windibank, it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a\\n', '     petty way as ever came before me. Now, let me just run over the\\n', '     course of events, and you will contradict me if I go wrong.\"\\n', '\\n', '     The man sat huddled up in his chair, with his head sunk upon his\\n', '     breast, like one who is utterly crushed. Holmes stuck his feet up on\\n', '     the corner of the mantelpiece and, leaning back with his hands in his\\n', '     pockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed, than to us.\\n', '\\n', '     \"The man married a woman very much older than himself for her money,\"\\n', '     said he, \"and he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long\\n', '     as she lived with them. It was a considerable sum, for people in\\n', '     their position, and the loss of it would have made a serious\\n', '     difference. It was worth an effort to preserve it. The daughter was\\n', '     of a good, amiable disposition, but affectionate and warm-hearted in\\n', '     her ways, so that it was evident that with her fair personal\\n', '     advantages, and her little income, she would not be allowed to remain\\n', '     single long. Now her marriage would mean, of course, the loss of a\\n', '     hundred a year, so what does her stepfather do to prevent it? He\\n', '     takes the obvious course of keeping her at home and forbidding her to\\n', '     seek the company of people of her own age. But soon he found that\\n', '     that would not answer forever. She became restive, insisted upon her\\n', '     rights, and finally announced her positive intention of going to a\\n', '     certain ball. What does her clever stepfather do then? He conceives\\n', '     an idea more creditable to his head than to his heart. With the\\n', '     connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself, covered\\n', '     those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked the face with a moustache\\n', '     and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear voice into an\\n', \"     insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the girl's short\\n\", '     sight, he appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel, and keeps off other lovers by\\n', '     making love himself.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"It was only a joke at first,\" groaned our visitor. \"We never thought\\n', '     that she would have been so carried away.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Very likely not. However that may be, the young lady was very\\n', '     decidedly carried away, and, having quite made up her mind that her\\n', '     stepfather was in France, the suspicion of treachery never for an\\n', \"     instant entered her mind. She was flattered by the gentleman's\\n\", '     attentions, and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed\\n', '     admiration of her mother. Then Mr. Angel began to call, for it was\\n', '     obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a\\n', '     real effect were to be produced. There were meetings, and an\\n', \"     engagement, which would finally secure the girl's affections from\\n\", '     turning towards anyone else. But the deception could not be kept up\\n', '     forever. These pretended journeys to France were rather cumbrous. The\\n', '     thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a\\n', '     dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the\\n', \"     young lady's mind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor\\n\", '     for some time to come. Hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a\\n', '     Testament, and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something\\n', '     happening on the very morning of the wedding. James Windibank wished\\n', '     Miss Sutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as\\n', '     to his fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not\\n', '     listen to another man. As far as the church door he brought her, and\\n', '     then, as he could go no farther, he conveniently vanished away by the\\n', '     old trick of stepping in at one door of a four-wheeler and out at the\\n', '     other. I think that was the chain of events, Mr. Windibank!\"\\n', '\\n', '     Our visitor had recovered something of his assurance while Holmes had\\n', '     been talking, and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon\\n', '     his pale face.\\n', '\\n', '     \"It may be so, or it may not, Mr. Holmes,\" said he, \"but if you are\\n', '     so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who\\n', '     are breaking the law now, and not me. I have done nothing actionable\\n', '     from the first, but as long as you keep that door locked you lay\\n', '     yourself open to an action for assault and illegal constraint.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"The law cannot, as you say, touch you,\" said Holmes, unlocking and\\n', '     throwing open the door, \"yet there never was a man who deserved\\n', '     punishment more. If the young lady has a brother or a friend, he\\n', '     ought to lay a whip across your shoulders. By Jove!\" he continued,\\n', '     flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the man\\'s face, \"it\\n', \"     is not part of my duties to my client, but here's a hunting crop\\n\", '     handy, and I think I shall just treat myself to--\" He took two swift\\n', '     steps to the whip, but before he could grasp it there was a wild\\n', '     clatter of steps upon the stairs, the heavy hall door banged, and\\n', '     from the window we could see Mr. James Windibank running at the top\\n', '     of his speed down the road.\\n', '\\n', '     \"There\\'s a cold-blooded scoundrel!\" said Holmes, laughing, as he\\n', '     threw himself down into his chair once more. \"That fellow will rise\\n', '     from crime to crime until he does something very bad, and ends on a\\n', '     gallows. The case has, in some respects, been not entirely devoid of\\n', '     interest.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"I cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning,\" I\\n', '     remarked.\\n', '\\n', '     \"Well, of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr. Hosmer\\n', '     Angel must have some strong object for his curious conduct, and it\\n', '     was equally clear that the only man who really profited by the\\n', '     incident, as far as we could see, was the stepfather. Then the fact\\n', '     that the two men were never together, but that the one always\\n', '     appeared when the other was away, was suggestive. So were the tinted\\n', '     spectacles and the curious voice, which both hinted at a disguise, as\\n', '     did the bushy whiskers. My suspicions were all confirmed by his\\n', '     peculiar action in typewriting his signature, which, of course,\\n', '     inferred that his handwriting was so familiar to her that she would\\n', '     recognise even the smallest sample of it. You see all these isolated\\n', '     facts, together with many minor ones, all pointed in the same\\n', '     direction.\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"And how did you verify them?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"Having once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration. I knew\\n', '     the firm for which this man worked. Having taken the printed\\n', '     description, I eliminated everything from it which could be the\\n', '     result of a disguise--the whiskers, the glasses, the voice, and I\\n', '     sent it to the firm, with a request that they would inform me whether\\n', '     it answered to the description of any of their travellers. I had\\n', '     already noticed the peculiarities of the typewriter, and I wrote to\\n', '     the man himself at his business address asking him if he would come\\n', '     here. As I expected, his reply was typewritten and revealed the same\\n', '     trivial but characteristic defects. The same post brought me a letter\\n', '     from Westhouse & Marbank, of Fenchurch Street, to say that the\\n', '     description tallied in every respect with that of their employee,\\n', '     James Windibank. VoilÃ  tout!\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"And Miss Sutherland?\"\\n', '\\n', '     \"If I tell her she will not believe me.

The men had known each other in the colonies, so that\\n', '     it was not unnatural that when they came to settle down they should\\n', '     do so as near each other as possible. Turner was apparently the\\n', '     richer man, so McCarthy became his tenant but still remained, it\\n', '     seems, upon terms of perfect equality, as they were frequently\\n', '     together.

As\\n', '     in summer, the best bait is whatever the fish are taking at\\n', '     the time.\\n', '          Moose hunting is another favorite sport, especially in\\n', '     the colder weather when the moose are on the move for food\\n', '     and warmth. The hunter faces problems similar to the pilot\\n', '     with his equipment. The extreme temperatures require that\\n', '     his snowmachine be kept in top condition if it is to start\\n', '     after a day of hunting.
